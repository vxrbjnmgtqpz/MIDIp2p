# JamNet Development Roadmap

## JSONMIDI + JELLIE Framework with TOAST Transport Layer

_Building the complete JSON-based audio+MIDI streaming ecosystem_

---

## Project Overview

**JamNet** is a comprehensive real-time audio and MIDI streaming platform built on JSON-based protocols. The system consists of two parallel streaming frameworks:

- **MIDIp2p**: MIDI events and control data via JSONMIDI format
- **JELLIE**: Audio sample streaming via JSONADAT format

Both systems use the **TOAST (Transport Oriented Audio Synchronization Tunnel)** UDP-based protocol with **PNTBTR (Predictive Network Temporal Buffered Transmission Recovery)** for musical continuity over packet loss.

### Current Scope: Dual-Stream Architecture

- ‚úÖ JSON-based MIDI protocol specification (JSONMIDI)
- ‚úÖ JSON-based audio protocol specification (JSONADAT)
- ‚úÖ Ultra-low-latency JSON parsing (Bassoon.js concept)
- üîÑ UDP-based synchronization tunnel (TOAST)
- üîÑ Musical prediction recovery system (PNTBTR)
- üîÑ Distributed clock synchronization (ClockDriftArbiter)
- ‚è≥ JUCE plugin integration
- ‚è≥ Real-time MIDI+Audio streaming over network

### Future Scope: Complete Collaboration Platform

- Video synchronization
- Collaborative DAW features
- Cloud audio processing
- Mobile platform support
