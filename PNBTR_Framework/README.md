PNBTR completely eliminates traditional noise-based dithering, replacing it with mathematically informed, waveform-aware LSB reconstruction that predicts what infinite-resolution analog audio would sound like.

## Core UDP GPU Integration

**PNBTR is designed for JAMNet's stateless, fire-and-forget architecture:**

### **Stateless Audio Reconstruction**
- **Self-Contained Processing**: PNBTR reconstructs audio from individual packets without session state
- **Independent Prediction**: Each audio chunk processed independently - no dependencies on previous packets
- **Zero-State Recovery**: Lost packets reconstructed using only available context - no waiting for retransmission
- **Real-Time Reconstruction**: GPU shaders provide immediate audio reconstruction without buffering delays

### **Fire-and-Forget Compatibility**
- **No Retransmission Dependency**: PNBTR never waits for lost packets - reconstructs immediately
- **Continuous Audio Flow**: Maintains unbroken audio stream regardless of packet loss
- **Multicast Optimization**: Single PNBTR-enhanced stream serves unlimited listeners simultaneously
- **Prediction-Based Recovery**: Neural networks predict missing audio content rather than requesting retransmission

### **GPU-Accelerated Architecture**
- **Parallel Reconstruction**: Thousands of GPU threads process audio prediction simultaneously
- **Real-Time Neural Inference**: <1ms processing time via compute shaders
- **Memory-Mapped Processing**: Zero-copy audio reconstruction from network buffers to GPU
- **Compute Shader Pipeline**: Full PNBTR processing stack runs on GPU for maximum performance

## Core Innovation

**Traditional Dithering** → **PNBTR Reconstruction**
- ❌ Adds random noise to mask quantization → ✅ Zero-noise mathematical reconstruction  
- ❌ Same noise pattern regardless of content → ✅ Waveform-aware, musically intelligent
- ❌ Audible artifacts at low bit depths → ✅ Pristine audio quality at any bit depth
- ❌ Static approach for all audio → ✅ Adaptive to musical context and style
