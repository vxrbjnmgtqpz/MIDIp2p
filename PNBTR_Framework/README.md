# PNBTR Framework

**Predictive Neural Buffered Transient Recovery - Open Source Revolutionary Dither Replacement**

PNBTR completely eliminates traditional noise-based dithering, replacing it with mathematically informed, waveform-aware LSB reconstruction that predicts what infinite-resolution analog audio would sound like.

## Core UDP GPU Integration

**PNBTR is designed for JAMNet's stateless, fire-and-forget architecture:**

### **Stateless Audio Reconstruction**
- **Self-Contained Processing**: PNBTR reconstructs audio from individual packets without session state
- **Independent Prediction**: Each audio chunk processed independently - no dependencies on previous packets
- **Zero-State Recovery**: Lost packets reconstructed using only available context - no waiting for retransmission
- **Real-Time Reconstruction**: GPU shaders provide immediate audio reconstruction without buffering delays

### **Fire-and-Forget Compatibility**
- **No Retransmission Dependency**: PNBTR never waits for lost packets - reconstructs immediately
- **Continuous Audio Flow**: Maintains unbroken audio stream regardless of packet loss
- **Multicast Optimization**: Single PNBTR-enhanced stream serves unlimited listeners simultaneously
- **Prediction-Based Recovery**: Neural networks predict missing audio content rather than requesting retransmission

### **GPU-Accelerated Architecture**
- **Parallel Reconstruction**: Thousands of GPU threads process audio prediction simultaneously
- **Real-Time Neural Inference**: <1ms processing time via compute shaders
- **Memory-Mapped Processing**: Zero-copy audio reconstruction from network buffers to GPU
- **Compute Shader Pipeline**: Full PNBTR processing stack runs on GPU for maximum performance

## Core Innovation

**Traditional Dithering** → **PNBTR Reconstruction**
- ❌ Adds random noise to mask quantization → ✅ Zero-noise mathematical reconstruction  
- ❌ Same noise pattern regardless of content → ✅ Waveform-aware, musically intelligent
- ❌ Audible artifacts at low bit depths → ✅ Pristine audio quality at any bit depth
- ❌ Static approach for all audio → ✅ Adaptive to musical context and style

## Revolutionary Architecture

### 🧠 Hybrid Prediction System
- **Autoregressive (LPC-like) Modeling**: Short-term waveform continuity
- **Pitch-Synchronized Cycle Reconstruction**: Harmonic analysis for tonal instruments
- **Envelope Tracking**: ADSR modeling with natural reverb reconstruction
- **Neural Inference Modules**: Lightweight RNNs/CNNs for non-linear patterns
- **Phase Alignment & Spectral Shaping**: FFT-based frequency domain reconstruction

### 🔥 GPU-Accelerated Processing
- **24-bit Default Operation**: Predictive LSB modeling extends perceived resolution
- **50ms Contextual Extrapolation**: Neural waveform prediction with musical awareness
- **Zero-Noise Audio**: No random noise added - ever
- **Real-Time Inference**: <1ms processing time via compute shaders

### 🌐 Continuous Learning System
- **Reference Recording**: Original signals archived lossless for training ground truth
- **Reconstruction Pairing**: Every PNBTR output paired with reference for training data
- **Global Dataset**: Worldwide JAMNet sessions contribute to distributed learning
- **Automated Retraining**: Models improve continuously from real-world usage
- **Physics-Based Extrapolation**: Infers higher bit-depth content from 24-bit patterns
