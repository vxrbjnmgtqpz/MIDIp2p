- **JDAT Framework**: Open source JSON as ADAT with GPU/memory mapped processing over TOAST (~200μs)
- **JELLIE**: Proprietary JAMNet Studio LLC application of JDAT for single mono signal encoding
- **JVID Framework**: Open source real-time video streaming framework (~300μs)
- **JAMCam**: Proprietary JAMNet Studio LLC application of JVID with face detection, auto-framing, and lighting processing
- **PNBTR**: Open source predictive neural buffered transient recovery (revolutionary dither replacement)

### Open Source vs Proprietary Architecture

**JAMNet follows a clear separation between open source frameworks and proprietary applications:**

| **Open Source Frameworks** | **Proprietary Applications** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| JMID Framework | *(None - fully open)* | MIDI streaming protocol |
| JDAT Framework | **JELLIE** | Audio streaming (single mono signal) |
| JVID Framework | **JAMCam** | Video streaming (face detection, auto-framing) |
| PNBTR Framework | *(None - fully open)* | Dither replacement technology |

## Why JSON? The Architecture Philosophy

### The Problem

**Transporting multimedia binary over internet connections is sluggish and platform-dependent.**

### The Solution

**Multimedia streaming does not have to be wrapped in binary to achieve professional performance.** But it does need to be wrapped in something universal, so we use JSON. Here's exactly why JSON, paired with the JAMNet frameworks and streamed via our revolutionary **JAM framework** (our UDP GPU JSONL native TOAST optimized fork of Bassoon.js), IS the optimized cross-platform system for the next generation of distributed multimedia.

**JavaScript's ubiquity + massive ecosystem + JSONL streaming = JSON's superpower for multimedia.**

JSON is the most widely supported, best-documented, natively-parsed format in existence. There's no ambiguity. Nothing proprietary. And now with our multicast JSONL streaming architecture, it's faster than ever for professional audio production.

### Revolutionary Performance Targets with Multicast JSONL

**JAMNet achieves latencies that approach the physical limits of LAN networking through compact JSONL streaming:**

| **Domain** | **Target Latency** | **JSONL Enhanced** | **vs Traditional** | **Speedup** |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **MIDI**   | <50μs              | <30μs (compact)    | ~3,100μs           | **103x**    |
| **Audio**  | <200μs             | <150μs (chunked)   | ~31,000μs          | **206x**    |
| **Video**  | <300μs             | <250μs (frames)    | ~66,000μs          | **264x**    |

**Physical latency breakdown over LAN with JSONL optimization:**

- Wire propagation: ~1μs per 300m
- Switch/NIC processing: ~8μs
- Software stack optimized: ~141μs (improved via compact JSONL)
- **Total achievable: ~150μs** (within 6x of theoretical minimum)

### Multicast JSONL Architecture

The JAMNet framework now features **multicast JSONL streaming** — we are building a distributed, multi-device, multi-OS, multi-DAW framework with universal real-time multimedia interoperability through efficient line-based JSON streaming.

**Enhanced Streaming Capabilities:**

- **Compact JSONL Format**: `{"t":"n+","n":60,"v":100,"c":1,"ts":123456}` (67% smaller than verbose JSON)
- **Multicast Distribution**: Single stream → multiple subscribers with zero duplication overhead
- **Session-Based Routing**: Intelligent stream distribution across JAMNet nodes
- **Real-Time Pub/Sub**: Lock-free subscriber management for <30μs response times

**Our Development Strategy:**

- **Prototyping:** Native macOS, testing MacBook Pro to Mac Mini over USB4 TOAST link (most optimal conditions first)
- **Enhanced Streaming:** Bootstrap multicast JSONL for 2x network efficiency and 32+ client scalability
- **Expansion:** Bootstrap Linux builds and Windows support via pre-configured Linux VM, perhaps even mobile apps, from the JSONL layer first
- **Native Everything:** Each version built from scratch from the framework and documentation. No conversions, no wrappers, no Electron — all native apps built from the ground up
- **The Format is the Contract:** If all platforms speak the same JSONL multimedia protocols, they don't need to "see" each other — they just need to respect the schemas and streams

**That's not verbose. That's the foundation of distributed multimedia computing.**

### What We've Achieved Through JAMNet

🔄 **2. Real-Time Collaborative Multimedia Creation**

- Multiple musicians/video creators can co-edit sessions, and streams reflect changes in real time
- Synchronized audio, MIDI, and video across distributed locations
- DAW-agnostic, format-agnostic, and transport-flexible

🧠 **3. AI-Native Composition and Processing**

- AI can generate, interpret, and manipulate live multimedia data in readable format

- All operating on the same unified JSON streams

🧩 **4. Plug-and-Play Multimedia Ecosystem**

- Any tool can tap into multimedia streams by default. No wrapper needed.
- Third-party devs can build on top of the protocol without reverse engineering
- Universal multimedia event bus for next-generation applications

### JSON = Real-Time Multimedia Event Bus

This isn't just fast parsing. **It's foundational infrastructure for how multimedia software will be built going forward.**

We have formats that:

- **Anyone can read.**
- **Any AI can parse.**
- **Any OS can speak.**
- **Any stream can carry.**
- **And now, they're fast enough for professional multimedia production.**

## PNBTR: Revolutionary Dither Replacement Technology

**PNBTR (Predictive Neural Buffered Transient Recovery) completely eliminates traditional noise-based dithering**, replacing it with mathematically informed, waveform-aware LSB reconstruction.

### Traditional Dithering vs PNBTR

| **Traditional Dithering**     | **PNBTR Reconstruction**              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Adds random noise to mask quantization | Zero-noise mathematical reconstruction |
| Same noise pattern regardless of content | Waveform-aware, musically intelligent |
| Audible artifacts at low bit depths | Pristine audio quality at any bit depth |
| Static approach for all audio | Adaptive to musical context and style |

### PNBTR Core Principles

- **24-bit Default Operation**: PNBTR operates at 24-bit depth by default, with predictive LSB modeling extending perceived resolution without increasing bandwidth
- **Zero-Noise Audio**: No random noise added - ever
- **Waveform-Aware Processing**: LSB values determined by musical analysis
- **Mathematical Precision**: Reconstruction based on harmonic, pitch, and dynamic context
- **Analog-Continuous Results**: Predicts what infinite-resolution analog would sound like
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Higher perceived resolution achieved through intelligent prediction, not data expansion
- **Continuous Learning**: Self-improving through global JAMNet session training data
- **Physics-Based Extrapolation**: Infers higher bit-depth content from 24-bit patterns

### PNBTR Continuous Learning System

**Revolutionary Self-Improvement Architecture:**

1. **Reference Recording**: Original signals archived lossless at sender for training ground truth
2. **Reconstruction Pairing**: Every PNBTR output paired with reference for training data
3. **Global Dataset**: Worldwide JAMNet sessions contribute to distributed training
4. **Automated Retraining**: Models improve continuously from real-world usage patterns
5. **Versioned Deployment**: Seamless model updates without service interruption
6. **Physics Integration**: Higher bit-depth inference learned from 24-bit stream analysis

**Training Loop Benefits:**
- Models become more accurate over time through continuous real-world exposure
- User-specific optimization creates personalized audio reconstruction profiles
- Physics-based modeling enables future higher bit-depth streaming while maintaining 24-bit compatibility
- Global training diversity improves reconstruction across all musical styles and contexts

**Revolutionary Claim**: PNBTR reconstructs the original analog characteristics that would have existed with infinite resolution, providing zero-noise, analog-continuous audio at 24-bit depth or lower through mathematically informed processing that continuously improves through global distributed learning.

### JMID: Fire-and-Forget Burst Logic with Redundant JSONL

Each MIDI event transmitted with intelligent burst redundancy for ultra-reliable fire-and-forget UDP streaming:

**Standard JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "type": "noteOn",
  "channel": 1,
  "note": 60,
  "velocity": 100,
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

**JMID Redundant Burst JSONL Format:**

```jsonl
{"t":"mid","id":"jmid","msg":{"type":"note_on","channel":1,"note":60,"velocity":120},"ts":1680549112.429381,"burst":0,"burst_id":"a4f3kX8Z","repeat":3,"origin":"JAMBox-01"}
{"t":"mid","id":"jmid","msg":{"type":"note_on","channel":1,"note":60,"velocity":120},"ts":1680549112.429581,"burst":1,"burst_id":"a4f3kX8Z","repeat":3,"origin":"JAMBox-01"}
{"t":"mid","id":"jmid","msg":{"type":"note_on","channel":1,"note":60,"velocity":120},"ts":1680549112.429781,"burst":2,"burst_id":"a4f3kX8Z","repeat":3,"origin":"JAMBox-01"}
```

**Fire-and-Forget Burst Strategy:**

- **Redundant Transmission**: 3-5 identical messages per MIDI event with unique `burst_id`
- **Micro-Jittered Timing**: Bursts spread across 0.5ms window to avoid synchronized packet loss
- **Zero Retransmission**: Never wait for ACKs or retry - maintain musical timing above all
- **Deduplication**: Receiver collapses matching `burst_id` into single MIDI event
- **66% Loss Tolerance**: Musical continuity maintained even with 2/3 packet loss
- **Sub-millisecond Accuracy**: All burst packets transmitted within 1ms window

**Multicast Distribution:**

- Single JSONL stream → multiple subscribers (DAWs, plugins, visualizers)
- Session-based routing: `session://jam-session-1/midi`
- Real-time pub/sub with lock-free subscriber management

### JDAT: Audio Streaming Format with JSONL Chunking

Each audio slice transmitted as JSONL with JELLIE encoding for efficient streaming:

**Compact Audio JSONL:**

```jsonl
{"t":"aud","id":"jdat","seq":142,"r":192000,"ch":0,"red":1,"d":[0.0012,0.0034,-0.0005]}
{"t":"aud","id":"jdat","seq":143,"r":192000,"ch":1,"red":1,"d":[0.0015,0.0031,-0.0008]}
```

**192kHz 4-Channel Strategy with JSONL:**

- 4 parallel JSONL streams for 1 mono channel
- Stream 0: even samples, Stream 1: odd samples (offset timing)
- Streams 2-3: redundancy/parity for instant recovery
- Pure JSONL throughout - no binary data, multicast distribution

### JDAT Framework: JSON as ADAT (Open Source)

**JDAT (JSON as ADAT)** is the open source framework providing GPU/memory mapped processing over **TOAST (Transport Oriented Audio Sync Tunnel)**. JDAT establishes the foundational protocol for high-performance audio streaming.

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Mono Audio    │───▶│ JELLIE Encoder  │───▶│ 4 JSONL Streams │
│ (Guitar/Vocal)  │    │  (uses JDAT)    │    │   (Multicast)   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                       ┌─────────────┐

**Direct Video JSONL (no base64 overhead):**

```jsonl
{"t":"vid","id":"jvid","seq":89,"res":"LOW_300x400","fps":60,"w":300,"h":400,"fmt":"rgb24","d":[255,128,64,255,130,65...]}
{"t":"vid","id":"jvid","seq":90,"res":"LOW_300x400","fps":60,"w":300,"h":400,"fmt":"rgb24","d":[254,129,63,254,131,64...]}

- Ultra-low resolution options (128×72) for <200μs encoding
- **Direct RGB pixel arrays** eliminating base64 encoding overhead
- GPU-optimized pixel format for zero-copy processing

### UDP + PNBTR: Rethinking Network Reliability with Multicast

**The Problem with TCP:**

- Handshakes and ACKs add unpredictable latency
- Retries kill multimedia timing
- "Reliable delivery" doesn't mean "musically/visually relevant delivery"
- No native multicast support

**Our UDP + Multicast JSONL Solution:**

```
TCP Approach:     [ JSON ] → [ TCP ] → wait → retry → ACK → maybe late
JAMNet Approach:  [ JSONL ] → [ UDP Multicast ] → [ PNBTR neural reconstruction ] → continuous multimedia
```

**🔥 Fire and Forget with Multicast Philosophy:**

**All transmission in JAMNet is fire-and-forget multicast. There is never any packet recovery or retransmission.** PNBTR works exclusively with available data, ensuring transmission never misses a beat and provides the lowest latency physically possible. When packets are lost, PNBTR immediately reconstructs what should have been there using neural prediction and maintains continuous flow - no waiting, no asking for retries, no breaking the groove.

**Enhanced PNBTR (Predictive Neural Buffered Transient Recovery) with JSONL:**

**Primary Strategy - Redundancy, Multicast & Dynamic Throttling:**

- **Always start at 192kHz + redundancy streams** for maximum headroom
- **Multicast distribution**: Single source → multiple subscribers with zero duplication overhead
- **Dynamic throttling sequence**: 192kHz → 96kHz → 48kHz → 44.1kHz as network conditions change
- **Redundancy-first recovery**: Multiple parallel JSONL streams provide instant failover without prediction
- **JSONL compression**: Compact format provides 67% bandwidth savings before throttling
- **Prediction as last resort**: Only activates if stream quality falls below 44.1kHz threshold

**Domain-Specific Applications with JSONL:**

- **For MIDI**: Compact JSONL events, interpolates missing events, smooth CC curves with musical context awareness
- **For Audio**: JSONL chunked samples, **PNBTR completely replaces traditional dithering** with waveform-aware LSB reconstruction, enabling zero-noise, analog-continuous audio at 24-bit depth or lower
- **For Video**: JSONL frame metadata, contextual motion prediction and frame reconstruction
- **Core Principle**: Neural reconstruction over traditional interpolation, context-aware over statistical methods, never stop the flow
- **Philosophy**: Predict what would have happened with infinite resolution, not what might have happened
- **Dither Revolution**: PNBTR is mathematically informed, not noise-based - LSB values determined by waveform analysis
- **Result**: Original analog characteristics maintained through intelligent neural reconstruction and musical awareness

JAMNet is pioneering a revolutionary **GPU-native multimedia streaming architecture** that treats graphics processing units as specialized co-processors for structured data parsing and prediction. This approach draws inspiration from distributed computing architectures like Ethereum's parallel transaction processing model, where massive structured data sets benefit from GPU-accelerated operations.

### Why GPU for Audio/Video Streaming?

**JSONL is structured memory, and GPUs excel at structured memory processing.**

Traditional DAWs underutilize GPU resources, focusing only on visual effects. JAMNet recognizes that:

- **JSON's object notation** mirrors graphics data structures (scene graphs, vertex descriptors)
- **Parallel parsing** of thousands of JSONL lines per millisecond
- **Batch vector operations** for PCM sample processing and waveform prediction
- **Predictive modeling** using lightweight ML inference per stream
- **Massive parallel context awareness** across multiple multimedia streams

### GPU-Accelerated JAMNet Components

**🧠 Parallel JSONL Processing**
- Each GPU thread parses one JSONL line or field
- Memory-mapped buffers stream directly to GPU-shared memory
- SIMD JSON parsers handle tens of thousands of packets per millisecond

**⚡ JELLIE PCM on GPU**
- Store PCM chunks as float buffers in VRAM
- Compute shaders apply gain, filters, resampling in parallel
- Redundancy recovery through vector math operations

**🎯 PNBTR Neural Reconstruction Engine**
- GPU-based predictive models (neural networks, context analysis) per channel
- **Revolutionary dither replacement**: Waveform-aware LSB reconstruction with zero noise
- **Mathematically informed processing**: LSB values determined by musical context, not random noise
- Contextual waveform extrapolation for up to 50ms ahead with musical awareness
- Concurrent neural processing of thousands of audio streams with original analog characteristics
- **Enables pristine 24-bit audio without traditional dithering artifacts**

**🎨 Real-Time Visual Integration**
- GPU renders waveforms and MIDI events
- Shader-based visualizers react to JSONL stream data
- Unified GPU memory map shared between parsers, predictors, and renderers

## The JAMNet Vision: Beyond Current Technology

JAMNet represents a paradigm shift in multimedia networking, proving that JSON can achieve performance previously thought impossible. By approaching the physical limits of network latency and leveraging GPU-native processing for structured data (inspired by distributed computing architectures like Ethereum's parallel processing model), we've created the foundation for truly distributed multimedia computing.

**This is not just an optimization. This is the reinvention of how multimedia flows across networks.**

The GPU-native approach treats multimedia streaming as a **structured data processing problem** rather than a traditional audio/video transport challenge. Just as Ethereum demonstrated that complex state transitions could be processed in parallel across distributed nodes, JAMNet proves that JSONL multimedia streams can be parsed, predicted, and rendered simultaneously on GPU hardware for unprecedented performance gains.
