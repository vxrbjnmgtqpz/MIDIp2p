# JAMNet: JSON Audio Multicast Framework

**Real-time multimedia streaming over JSON with ultra-low-latency networking for distributed audio/video collaboration.**

## What is JAM?

**JAM** = **JSON Audio Multicast**

A revolutionary framework that makes JSON fast enough to stream professional-grade multimedia content at microsecond latencies, replacing traditional binary protocols while maintaining human-readable, web-compatible benefits.

## Overview

JAMNet is a comprehensive framework for streaming multimedia data over the internet using JSON, providing complete audio, video, and MIDI collaboration capabilities. The project enables real-time distributed multimedia sessions using the TOAST (Transport Oriented Audio Synchronization Tunnel) protocol with latencies approaching the physical limits of networking.

**What started as MIDIp2p has evolved into the complete JAMNet ecosystem:**

- **JSONMIDI Framework**: Ultra-low latency MIDI streaming (~100Î¼s)
- **JSONADAT Framework**: Professional audio streaming with JELLIE encoding (~200Î¼s)
- **JSONVID Framework**: Real-time video with JAMCam processing (~300Î¼s)

## Why JSON? The Architecture Philosophy

### The Problem

**Transporting multimedia binary over internet connections is sluggish and platform-dependent.**

### The Solution

**Multimedia streaming does not have to be wrapped in binary to achieve professional performance.** But it does need to be wrapped in something universal, so we use JSON. Here's exactly why JSON, paired with the JAMNet frameworks and streamed via Bassoon.js, IS the optimized cross-platform system for the next generation of distributed multimedia.

**JavaScript's ubiquity + massive ecosystem = JSON's superpower for multimedia.**

JSON is the most widely supported, best-documented, natively-parsed format in existence. There's no ambiguity. Nothing proprietary. And now it's fast enough for professional audio production.

### Revolutionary Performance Targets

**JAMNet achieves latencies that approach the physical limits of LAN networking:**

| **Domain** | **Target Latency** | **vs Traditional** | **Speedup** |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **MIDI**   | <100Î¼s             | ~3,100Î¼s           | **31x**     |
| **Audio**  | <200Î¼s             | ~31,000Î¼s          | **155x**    |
| **Video**  | <300Î¼s             | ~66,000Î¼s          | **220x**    |

**Physical latency breakdown over LAN:**

- Wire propagation: ~1Î¼s per 300m
- Switch/NIC processing: ~8Î¼s
- Software stack optimized: ~191Î¼s
- **Total achievable: ~200Î¼s** (within 8x of theoretical minimum)

### Modular Architecture, Not Verbose

The JAMNet framework is a **broadcast language** â€” we are building a distributed, multi-device, multi-OS, multi-DAW framework with universal real-time multimedia interoperability.

**Our Development Strategy:**

- **Prototyping:** Native macOS, testing MacBook Pro to Mac Mini over USB4 TOAST link (most optimal conditions first)
- **Expansion:** Bootstrap Windows and Linux builds, perhaps even mobile apps, from the JSON layer first
- **Native Everything:** Each version built from scratch from the framework and documentation. No conversions, no wrappers, no Electron â€” all native apps built from the ground up
- **The Format is the Contract:** If all platforms speak the same JSON multimedia protocols, they don't need to "see" each other â€” they just need to respect the schemas and streams

**That's not verbose. That's the foundation of distributed multimedia computing.**

### What We've Achieved Through JAMNet

ðŸŽ¯ **1. True Cross-Platform Multimedia Sync Without Conversion Lag**

- If every system (macOS, Windows, Linux, mobile) is reading the same JSON streams, and decoding multimedia in microseconds...
- You've completely removed the need for any binary protocol or per-platform interpreter.

ðŸ”„ **2. Real-Time Collaborative Multimedia Creation**

- Multiple musicians/video creators can co-edit sessions, and streams reflect changes in real time
- Synchronized audio, MIDI, and video across distributed locations
- DAW-agnostic, format-agnostic, and transport-flexible

ðŸ§  **3. AI-Native Composition and Processing**

- AI can generate, interpret, and manipulate live multimedia data in readable format
- Generative audio/video plugins, reactive performance assistants, adaptive sync layers
- All operating on the same unified JSON streams

ðŸ§© **4. Plug-and-Play Multimedia Ecosystem**

- Any tool can tap into multimedia streams by default. No wrapper needed.
- Third-party devs can build on top of the protocol without reverse engineering
- Universal multimedia event bus for next-generation applications

### JSON = Real-Time Multimedia Event Bus

This isn't just fast parsing. **It's foundational infrastructure for how multimedia software will be built going forward.**

We have formats that:

- **Anyone can read.**
- **Any AI can parse.**
- **Any OS can speak.**
- **Any stream can carry.**
- **And now, they're fast enough for professional multimedia production.**

## The Complete JAMNet Ecosystem

### Unified Streaming Architecture

JAMNet provides a **triple-stream architecture** that handles MIDI, audio, and video through parallel JSON-based protocols:

| **MIDI Stack**             | **Audio Stack**                 | **Video Stack**            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **JSONMIDI**               | **JSONADAT**                    | **JSONVID**                |
| â†’ Events & control data    | â†’ PCM sample chunks (JELLIE)    | â†’ Frame data (JAMCam)      |
| â†’ <100Î¼s latency           | â†’ <200Î¼s latency                | â†’ <300Î¼s latency           |
| â†’ PNTBTR fills lost events | â†’ PNTBTR predicts waveform gaps | â†’ PNTBTR motion prediction |
| â†’ Sent over TOAST/UDP      | â†’ Sent over TOAST/UDP           | â†’ Sent over TOAST/UDP      |

### JSONADAT: Audio Streaming Format

Each audio slice transmitted as readable JSON with JELLIE encoding:

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "id": "jsonadat",
  "seq": 142,
  "rate": 192000,
  "channel": 0,
  "redundancy": 1,
  "data": {
    "samples": [0.0012, 0.0034, -0.0005, ...]
  }
}
```

**192kHz ADAT Strategy:**

- 4 parallel streams for 1 mono channel
- Stream 0: even samples, Stream 1: odd samples (offset timing)
- Streams 2-3: redundancy/parity for instant recovery
- Pure JSON throughout - no binary data

### JSONVID: Video Streaming Format

Each video frame with JAMCam processing:

```json
{
  "type": "video_frame",
  "id": "jsonvid",
  "seq": 89,
  "resolution": "ULTRA_LOW_72P",
  "fps": 60,
  "jamcam": {
    "face_detected": true,
    "auto_framed": true,
    "lighting_normalized": 0.85
  },
  "data": {
    "frame": "base64_compressed_frame_data"
  }
}
```

**JAMCam Features:**

- Face detection and auto-framing
- Adaptive lighting normalization
- Motion-compensated encoding
- Ultra-low resolution options (128Ã—72) for <200Î¼s encoding

### UDP + PNTBTR: Rethinking Network Reliability

**The Problem with TCP:**

- Handshakes and ACKs add unpredictable latency
- Retries kill multimedia timing
- "Reliable delivery" doesn't mean "musically/visually relevant delivery"

**Our UDP + PNTBTR Solution:**

```
TCP Approach:     [ JSON ] â†’ [ TCP ] â†’ wait â†’ retry â†’ ACK â†’ maybe late
JAMNet Approach:  [ JSON ] â†’ [ UDP ] â†’ [ PNTBTR prediction ] â†’ continuous multimedia
```

**ðŸ”¥ Fire and Forget Philosophy:**

**All transmission in JAMNet is fire-and-forget. There is never any packet recovery or retransmission.** PNTBTR works exclusively with available data, ensuring transmission never misses a beat and provides the lowest latency physically possible. When packets are lost, PNTBTR immediately predicts what should have been there and maintains continuous flow - no waiting, no asking for retries, no breaking the groove.

**PNTBTR (Predictive Network Temporal Buffered Transmission Recovery):**

**Primary Strategy - Redundancy & Dynamic Throttling:**
- **Always start at 192kHz + redundancy streams** for maximum headroom
- **Dynamic throttling sequence**: 192kHz â†’ 96kHz â†’ 48kHz â†’ 44.1kHz as network conditions change
- **Redundancy-first recovery**: Multiple parallel streams provide instant failover without prediction
- **Prediction as last resort**: Only activates if stream quality falls below 44.1kHz threshold

**Domain-Specific Applications:**
- **For MIDI**: Interpolates missing events, smooth CC curves (prediction backup only)
- **For Audio**: Maintains waveform through throttling first, predicts only below 44.1kHz
- **For Video**: Frame rate adaptation before motion prediction kicks in
- **Core Principle**: Redundancy over prediction, throttling over interpolation, never stop the flow
- **Philosophy**: High sample rate + backup streams beats prediction every time
- **Result**: Professional quality maintained through intelligent bandwidth management, not guesswork

## JAMNet Protocol Evolution

### TOAST Protocol Layers

```
Application    â†’    JAMNet multimedia apps
Encoding      â†’    JSONMIDI / JSONADAT / JSONVID
Transport     â†’    TOAST (UDP-only, unified across domains)
Recovery      â†’    PNTBTR (domain-specific prediction)
Clock Sync    â†’    Unified timestamp across all streams
```

**Why UDP Won Across All Domains:**

- ðŸ”¥ No handshakes - immediate transmission
- âš¡ Sub-millisecond latency achievable
- ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for LAN and metro-area networks
- ðŸ§± PNTBTR handles gaps intelligently per domain
