- **Response**: Full progression with emotional analysis and audio playback

#### **Type 2: Single Chord Requests** ✅
- **Triggers**: "What chord represents...", "Give me a chord for..."
- **Primary Model**: Individual Chord Model
- **Secondary Models**: Theory Engine (for theoretical context)
- **Example**: *"What chord represents deep sadness?"*
- **Response**: Single chord with emotional weights and theory context

#### **Type 3: Music Theory Requests** ✅
- **Triggers**: Style names, mode names, theoretical terms
- **Primary Model**: Enhanced Solfege Theory Engine
- **Secondary Models**: Progression Model (for emotional context)
- **Example**: *"Show me a Jazz progression in Dorian mode"*
- **Response**: Theoretically accurate progression with style analysis

#### **Type 4: Comparative Analysis** ✅
- **Triggers**: "Compare...", "Show me different styles...", "How would X sound in Y style?"
- **Primary Model**: Enhanced Solfege Theory Engine
- **Secondary Models**: All models for comprehensive analysis
- **Example**: *"How would sadness sound in Jazz vs Classical?"*
- **Response**: Multi-style comparison with emotional context

#### **Type 5: Educational Requests** ✅
