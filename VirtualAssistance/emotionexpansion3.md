Perfect. I’ll compile 20 malice-based sub-emotions, ranging from overt hostility to covert antisocial traits. Each one will include:

- A clear definition
- Musical mode assignment (including mixed modes and variants)
- A representative chord progression grounded in theory
- Genre associations where relevant

I’ll pull from psychological sources including DSM-5 traits, emotional taxonomy research, and cinematic or musical theory where applicable. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.

# Malice-Based Sub-Emotions and Musical Representations

Below is a list of 20 sub-emotions under the umbrella of **Malice**, each with a definition and a proposed musical mode to represent it. For each, a default chord progression in that mode is given, along with a rationale connecting the mode’s musical character to the emotion. (Modes/hybrid scales were chosen to capture the overt or subtle malevolent qualities described, drawing on their typical emotional connotations in music.)

1. **Sadism** – _Definition:_ Sadism is the tendency to derive pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others. It is a cruel antisocial trait often linked with dominance and violence.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Phrygian Dominant** (a **minor** mode with a major 3rd and flat 2nd).
   _Default Progression:_ **I–♭II–I–♭vii** (e.g., in E Phrygian Dominant: E major – F major – E – D minor).
   _Rationale:_ The Phrygian dominant scale has a foreboding, “evil” sound suited to dark intent. The clash between the major tonic and the flat second (e.g. E–F) creates an exotic, menacing tension associated with villainous or cruel characters. This progression, oscillating between an unstable ♭II and the tonic, musically mirrors sadistic teasing – providing resolution only to yank it away. The mode’s use in heavy metal and horror underscores its capacity to evoke merciless, aggressive moods. _(Genres/Contexts: often used for **villain themes**, **horror soundtracks**, or metal riffs to signify cruel glee.)_

2. **Narcissism** – _Definition:_ Narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Narcissistic individuals feel superior and entitled, exploiting others with arrogance.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Double Harmonic Major** (aka **Byzantine scale**: a major scale with **♭2** and **♭6** degrees).
   _Default Progression:_ **I–♭II–V–I** (e.g., in C Double Harmonic Major: C major – D♭ major – G7 – C).
   _Rationale:_ The double harmonic major scale is intensely exotic and dramatic. Its bold augmented seconds (e.g. C–D♭ and G–A♭) and raised seventh create an almost regal yet unsettling sound, befitting the **grandiosity** and **menace** of malignant narcissism. The I–♭II progression introduces a startling clash (much like a narcissist’s imposing presence), while the V–I resolution provides a triumphant, authoritative cadence. This mode’s “majestic, mysterious” quality conveys false glamour and underlying tension – musically symbolizing narcissistic pride with a threatening edge. _(Genres/Contexts: **Middle Eastern** or **Romani-flavored** pieces, dramatic **neoclassical metal**, or scenes of a tyrant’s pomp can all use this scale to represent narcissistic ego.)_

3. **Machiavellianism** – _Definition:_ Machiavellianism is a personality trait defined by manipulativeness, deceitfulness, and a cynical view of others as pawns for one’s own gain. High “Mach” individuals are strategic, power-seeking, and will exploit or betray to achieve their ends.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Octatonic (Diminished) Scale** (an 8-note symmetric scale alternating half and whole steps).
   _Default Progression:_ **i°–♭iii°–♭v°–♭vii°** (cycle of diminished seventh chords, e.g., C°–E♭°–G♭°–A°–… back to C°).
   _Rationale:_ The diminished/octatonic scale produces a **“creepy,” tension-filled** atmosphere well-suited to scheming and intrigue. Its symmetry and abundance of diminished chords create a sense of constant calculation – there’s _no_ comfortable resolution, just as a Machiavellian plot is always in motion. The given progression cycles through fully diminished seventh chords by minor thirds, highlighting the scale’s unstable, chess-like moves. Each chord is equidistant, reflecting cunning precision and cold unpredictability. This endless spiral of dissonance musically embodies manipulation behind the scenes, as if the floor is always shifting underfoot. _(Genres/Contexts: Frequently used in suspenseful **spy/espionage scores** or **film noir** settings for schemers; also in avant-garde or **black metal** riffs to convey plotting and dread.)_

4. **Psychopathy** – _Definition:_ Psychopathy is marked by a profound lack of empathy or remorse, coupled with callous, egocentric and impulsive antisocial behavior. Psychopaths can be superficially charming but are detached and cold-hearted in their actions.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Locrian Mode** (the 7th mode of major – a **diminished** scale with a flattened 2nd and 5th).
   _Default Progression:_ **i°–♭II–♭VII–i°** (e.g., in B Locrian: B° – C – A minor – B°).
   _Rationale:_ Locrian is often considered the most unstable and “evil”-sounding of modes. Its diminished tonic chord (i°) and lowered 5th refuse to provide any sense of resolution or warmth – a fitting parallel to the psychopath’s moral void and lack of emotional center. The progression uses a B° diminished chord as tonic, moving to C major (♭II) and A minor (♭VII), then back, which creates a hollow, unnerving loop. This mirrors the **callousness** and **emptiness** of psychopathy: musically, we get tension without relief, and an almost mechanical cycling through dissonance. The disjointed tritone relations (e.g. B° to F (in B° chord) or to C) evoke an unsettling detachment. In essence, Locrian’s inherent dissonance and inability to “resolve” reflect the psychopath’s stunted emotional resolution and chronic antisocial mindset. _(Genres/Contexts: **Horror** and **thriller** scores use Locrian for monstrous or inhuman characters; its tension is also exploited in dissonant **death metal** passages to suggest extreme depravity.)_

5. **Cruelty** – _Definition:_ Cruelty is the **intentional infliction of suffering** on others or deliberate indifference to their pain. A cruel person often _enjoys_ or has no remorse about others’ distress, exhibiting sustained harshness and brutality.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Phrygian Mode** (natural minor with a **flat 2nd**).
   _Default Progression:_ **i–♭II–♭VI–i** (e.g., in E Phrygian: E minor – F major – C major – E minor).
   _Rationale:_ The Phrygian mode’s **dark, gloomy** charactercaptures the cold-heartedness of cruelty. The flattened 2nd (F against an E minor tonic, in this example) adds a sinister bite – a sonic parallel to someone twisting the knife. In the progression above, the move from E minor to F major (i–♭II) is jarring and cruel in itself, like an act of harm without warning. The inclusion of the ♭VI chord (C major in E Phrygian) injects a hollow, aeolian sadness into the progression, underlining the suffering aspect. Ending back on the minor tonic with no leading tone provides a sense of brooding finality, as cruelty often ends with cold indifference. Phrygian’s overall minor tonality and characteristic half-step tension (1–♭2) evoke an atmosphere of dread and merciless intent. _(Genres/Contexts: **Dark ambient** and **suspense music** lean on Phrygian for oppressive, cruel atmospheres; also common in **extreme metal** riffs to add a brutal, unforgiving edge.)_

6. **Spite** – _Definition:_ Spite is a bitter desire to hurt, annoy, or frustrate someone **even if it harms oneself**, arising from petty ill-will. It’s often vindictive and self-destructive (“cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face”).
   _Musical Mode:_ **Hungarian Minor** (a **harmonic minor** variant with a raised 4th – e.g. 1, 2, ♭3, ♯4, 5, ♭6, 7).
   _Default Progression:_ **i–♭III⁺–V–i** (e.g., in A Hungarian Minor: A minor – Caug – E major – A minor).
   _Rationale:_ The Hungarian minor scale has an exaggerated, sharp-edged quality (with two augmented seconds) that fits spite’s mix of bitterness and perversity. The raised 4th (♯4) alongside the minor third produces a sneaky, piquant dissonance – as heard between D♯ and C in A Hungarian minor. This can sound almost taunting or sarcastic. In the progression, the use of Caug (♭III⁺) – an **augmented chord** – highlights the unnaturally heightened tension (augmented triads feel unresolved and “piercing”, much like spiteful actions that gain nothing constructive). The V–i resolution (E–Am) gives a brief classical drama (a nod to the **harmonic minor** heritage) but here it feels ironically grand for a petty motive, underlining how spite can be melodramatic. Overall, the exotic, abrasive flair of Hungarian minor reflects the _perversity_ of hurting others at one’s own expense – it’s a minor mode that “bends” out of shape, just as spite defies rational benefit. _(Genres/Contexts: Useful in **Eastern European or Klezmer-influenced** cues and in theatrical **villain vignettes** where a character’s petty malice is portrayed with a sly, quirky darkness.)_

7. **Vindictiveness** – _Definition:_ Vindictiveness is a _vengeful_ attitude – a **persistent desire for revenge** and retribution for perceived wrongs. It involves holding grudges and planning to retaliate with equal or greater harm.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Harmonic Minor** (natural minor with a **raised 7th** degree).
   _Default Progression:_ **i–iv–V–i** (e.g., in D harmonic minor: Dm – Gm – A major – Dm).
   _Rationale:_ The harmonic minor scale, with its distinctive raised seventh, creates strong musical tension and a **dramatic, vengeful** mood. The presence of a leading tone (C♯ in D minor) makes the V (A major) a _dominant_ that yearns to resolve – symbolizing the fixated drive toward retribution. In the progression, the move from the minor i (Dm) through the minor iv (Gm) to the major V (A) builds a feeling of escalating tension and dark resolve, finally resolving back to the somber i. This mirrors the trajectory of revenge: brooding (i, iv), confronting (V dominant), then a dark satisfaction (back to i). The harmonic minor mode’s rich, Middle Eastern or classical coloring has long been used to underscore intense passion and drama – here it represents the **smoldering anger** and _inevitability_ of a vengeful payoff. _(Genres/Contexts: **Classical scores** and **opera** often use harmonic minor for revenge arias; in film and game music, it underscores **epic revenge montages** or villain comeback scenes, with its tense V–i pull embodying an impending reckoning.)_

8. **Hatred** – _Definition:_ Hatred is an **intense hostility** and aversion toward someone or something, often with a desire to see the target harmed. It is a sustained extreme dislike (loathing) coupled with ill-will.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Locrian Mode** (the most dissonant diatonic mode, with a **diminished tonic**).
   _Default Progression:_ **i°–♭V–♭VI–i°** (e.g., in B Locrian: B° – F major – G major – B°).
   _Rationale:_ Locrian’s tonal instability – notably the diminished i chord (B-D-F in this case) and flatted fifth – effectively conveys **seething animosity**. The lack of a perfect fifth in the scale means there’s no musical “rest,” just as pure hatred offers no peace or resolution. In the example, the progression starts and ends on the dissonant B° chord, never resolving to a stable consonance, which leaves a sense of _unrelieved tension_. The insertion of major chords (F and G) built on the flattened fifth and sixth degrees creates a grotesque contrast – momentary brightness that quickly collapses back into the diminished tonic. This is analogous to hatred sometimes masquerading behind a forced smile, yet inevitably returning to its core bitterness. Locrian’s overall discord (often described as “evil” or diabolical in sound) captures the depth of malice in true hatred. _(Genres/Contexts: Used in **horror and dark suspense** music to depict pure malice or in extreme **metal breakdowns** for a very abrasive atmosphere; the listener is left tense and uneasy, much as one would be in the presence of intense hatred.)_

9. **Malicious Envy** – _Definition:_ Envy is the painful longing for what someone else has. **Malicious envy** in particular means one not only covets the other’s advantage but also resents the possessor – _wishing ill_ upon them or hoping to strip away their success. This “leveling-down” envy comes with hostility toward the fortunate other.
   _Musical Mode:_ **Neapolitan Minor** (a hybrid scale – natural minor with a **♭2** and a raised 7th; essentially a _harmonic minor with a flatted 2nd_).
   _Default Progression:_ **i–♭II–V–i** (e.g., in A Neapolitan minor: A minor – B♭ major – E major – A minor).
   _Rationale:_ The Neapolitan minor scale provides an excellent musical analog to malicious envy’s mix of _yearning_ and _ill-will_. It contains the tense half-step between 1–♭2 (illustrating resentment) alongside the driving leading tone (illustrating desire/urgency). In the progression, the B♭ major chord (♭II, the “Neapolitan” chord) strikes with a bold, jealous dissonance against the A minor tonic, and then the V (E major with G♯) pulls sharply toward resolution, much like the envious person’s urgent wish to **bring the other down** or elevate themselves. The return to i (A minor) is bittersweet – it resolves the harmonic tension but lands in minor, reflecting how envy, even “satisfied” by another’s misfortune, remains an unpleasant emotion. This mode’s unusual mix of minor melancholy and biting chromaticism echoes the _toxic_ nature of malicious envy: sorrow entwined with hostility. _(Genres/Contexts: Often heard in **Romantic-era classical music** during tragic, jealous scenes – the Neapolitan chord is a hallmark of longing and doom. Also apt for **dramatic film scores** showing envy-fueled conflict, providing a rich, almost gothic darkness.)_

10. **Contempt** – _Definition:_ Contempt is a feeling of **deep disrespect or scorn** for someone deemed inferior. It combines anger and disgust with a sense of _superiority_ over the target. Facial contempt is marked by a sneer, indicating one considers the other beneath consideration.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Harmonic Major** (Ionian **♭6** scale: a major scale with a lowered 6th degree).
    _Default Progression:_ **I–iv–V–I** (e.g., in G harmonic major: G major – C minor – D major – G).
    _Rationale:_ The harmonic major mode has a bright major I but introduces an unexpected minor subdominant (iv) due to the flattened 6th (in G: E♭ makes C minor). This juxtaposition of major and minor encapsulates _condescension_ musically. The I chord (G major) asserts a proud, “on top” feeling (fitting the superiority element of contempt), then shifting to a minor iv (C minor) injects a dark, disapproving tone – as if the music is literally “looking down” with disdain. The progression resolves through a dominant (D) back to G, reinforcing the smug stability of the contemptuous person’s position. Harmonic major’s overall sound is somewhat **majestic yet somber**, which mirrors the moral high ground one feels in contempt (major, confident) mixed with disgust (the unusual flat-6 adds gravity). It’s simultaneously haughty and cold. _(Genres/Contexts: This mode appears in pieces that need a **stiff, pompous** quality with a dark edge – for instance, themes for corrupt nobility or judges in dramas. The I–iv shift is famously used in film music to give a stately theme a sudden air of disapproval, matching scenes of belittlement or scorn.)_

11. **Schadenfreude** – _Definition:_ Schadenfreude is **malicious joy** at another’s misfortune. It is the guilty pleasure or secret happiness one feels upon seeing someone else fail or suffer a setback.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Mixolydian Mode** (major scale with a **♭7**).
    _Default Progression:_ **I–♭VII–IV–I** (e.g., in E Mixolydian: E major – D major – A major – E).
    _Rationale:_ Schadenfreude contains an element of _glee_, albeit a nasty kind. The Mixolydian mode, being major but with a lowered 7th, often conveys a **rowdy, sly cheerfulness** – think of a mischievous grin. The progression E–D–A–E here has an upbeat, almost anthemic quality (common in folk or rock), which represents the **pleasure** component. But the inclusion of the ♭VII chord (D major in E) gives a slightly off-kilter, less innocent tone than a pure major scale would. This hints at the moral twist – a “laughing at someone” vibe. In effect, Mixolydian’s blend of brightness and bluesy subtonic can come across as _mocking_ or chortling. The music smiles (major I and IV) but with a wry twist (♭VII), much as a person feels happy about another’s pratfall but must hide it. This mode’s carefree, swaggering energy captures the essence of taking covert joy in something one **shouldn’t**. _(Genres/Contexts: Often used in **comedic or ironic soundtracks** – for example, a jaunty tune when an antagonist gets a taste of pain – as well as in **blues/rock** for its cheeky, slightly rebellious mood. It’s the musical equivalent of a taunting “ha-ha!” with a big grin.)_

12. **Manipulation** – _Definition:_ Manipulation is behavior that **influences or controls others** covertly for one’s own advantage, often through deception or emotional exploitation. A manipulative person alternates between charm and coercion to achieve their ends.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Parallel Major/Minor Hybrid** (alternation between a minor key and its parallel major).
    _Default Progression:_ **i – I – i – V** (e.g., in A: A minor – A major – A minor – E major).
    _Rationale:_ This hybrid approach captures manipulation’s two-faced nature. Shifting between minor and major on the same tonic is jarring – it’s as if the musical “mask” keeps flipping. In the example, A minor to A major changes the mood from sad/menacing to suddenly warm or uplifting, then back to minor. This mimics how manipulators can **feign positive emotions** (major) and then reveal cold intent (minor) in turn. The final V chord (E major in A) acts as a dominant that could lead anywhere – symbolizing the manipulator exerting control or leading the victim along. The unpredictability of mode mixture keeps the listener off-balance, just as a victim of manipulation is kept guessing by alternating kindness and cruelty. In essence, the major mode provides the “charm” or false reassurance, while the minor mode signifies the underlying ulterior motive. This deliberate modal whiplash is unsettling and reflective of duplicitous intent. _(Genres/Contexts: Common in **theatrical scores** or **psychological thrillers**, where a theme might shift from major to minor to illustrate a character’s hidden agenda. Classical composers sometimes used this technique (Picardy thirds, etc.) to suddenly brighten or darken a theme – useful here as a metaphor for emotional manipulation.)_

13. **Treachery** – _Definition:_ Treachery is a **betrayal of trust** or faith, often in a sneaky, traitorous manner. It implies trickery and backstabbing – harming someone who believed you were loyal.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Whole Tone Scale** (a six-note scale of only whole steps; e.g., C–D–E–F♯–G♯–A♯).
    _Default Progression:_ **I⁺ – ♭III⁺ – I⁺ – ♭V⁺** (e.g., C aug – E aug – C aug – G♯ aug).
    _Rationale:_ The whole tone scale’s **dreamlike, ambiguous** quality is ideal for portraying deceit and unreality. Because all its intervals are equal, it lacks a tonal center – everything feels slippery, like the ground constantly shifting (much how one feels when betrayed by someone trusted). The scale is comprised entirely of augmented chords or augmented intervals, which have an ethereal yet unsettling sound. In the progression above, we cycle through augmented chords a major third apart (C⁺ to E⁺ to G♯(A♭)⁺ and back). Augmented chords do not clearly sound major or minor; they feel suspended and secretive. This evokes the _illusive_ friendliness of a traitor – an appearance of harmony that is actually hollow. As there’s no strong resolution (augmented chords can lead ambiguously in multiple directions), the listener is left in a state of uncertainty, reflecting the rug-pulled-out feeling of treachery. The pattern I–♭III–I–♭V (all augmented) implies that what you see (I) is not what you get – the music continuously wanders off, like a lie revealed. _(Genres/Contexts: Frequently used in film to signify **hallucinations or deceit** – e.g., characters drugged or entering a dream (think of the classic “twinkling” whole-tone sound). In a betrayal scene, a sudden whole-tone passage can effectively underscore the moment loyalty turns to danger, emphasizing the unreality of the situation for the victim.)_

14. **Ruthlessness** – _Definition:_ Ruthlessness is the quality of having **no pity or compassion** for others. A ruthless person is merciless and will pursue their goals with brutal indifference to anyone harmed in the process.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Harmonic Minor** (minor with a leading tone, as used above, but employed here in a more aggressive context).
    _Default Progression:_ **i–♭VI–V–i** (e.g., in E harmonic minor: Em – C major – B major – Em).
    _Rationale:_ Harmonic minor’s dramatic tension can also illustrate cold determination. The raised 7th (D♯ in E minor) in the V chord (B major) creates a **forceful pull** into the resolution that can feel like an _unrelenting drive_. In this progression, the leap from the ♭VI (C) down to the dominant (B) is stark and forceful, much like a ruthless decision cutting away warmth (the C major chord provides a brief “human” major color, only to be followed by the dominant drive back to the somber Em). This drop from C to B has a descending semitone (C–B), a musical “deathblow” of sorts, which underlines merciless finality. The overall effect is minor and severe – the Em–B major cadence is strong and unfeeling. No frills or detours, just a direct minor resolution, symbolizing how a ruthless individual will not hesitate or waver from their aim. Harmonic minor provides the _“steel”_ in this resolve – its classical association with grave, fateful moments suits the idea of someone who will stop at nothing. _(Genres/Contexts: Effective in **epic soundtrack** moments where a character turns utterly merciless or an enemy advances relentlessly – the harmonic minor scale’s stern, driving quality is reminiscent of the “iron will” of warlords or villains (e.g., many **action scores** use minor with strong V–i movements to depict implacable forces).)_

15. **Wrath** – _Definition:_ Wrath is **fierce, violent anger** often with a desire for revenge or punishment. Unlike the cold planning of vindictiveness, wrath is hot-blooded fury, sometimes uncontrolled.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Altered Scale (Super Locrian)** – the 7th mode of melodic minor, essentially a dominant scale with every scale tone flattened except the root (e.g., C altered: C, D♭, E♭, E, G♭, A♭, B♭). This scale contains multiple dissonant intervals (♭2, ♭3, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7).
    _Default Progression:_ **V<sub>7alt</sub> – i – V<sub>7alt</sub> – i** (e.g., in context of A minor: E7♭9♭13 – Am – E7♭9♭13 – Am).
    _Rationale:_ The altered scale is one of the most **tension-saturated** scales in music – it’s essentially all the “wrong” notes over a dominant chord, creating maximum dissonance before resolution. This perfectly matches the quality of wrath: an explosion of tension and anger that demands release. In usage, the altered scale usually begs to resolve to a minor or major tonic (as E7alt -> Am above). By cycling an altered dominant to a minor chord and back, we simulate waves of fury that flare up (the harsh dominant with ♭9, ♭13, etc., represents the peak of rage) and then momentarily subside into minor (the aftermath or gathering for the next surge). The sound is that of flame and destruction – for example, an E7♭9♭13 chord contains a clash of F (♭9) and G♯ (3rd), D (♭13) and E (root), etc., embodying rageful discord. When it resolves to A minor, it’s like a hit landing. Then it rises again. Wrath doesn’t sit in a stable mode; it _alternates_ between extreme dissonance and minor resolution, illustrating recurring bursts of anger. The altered mode’s flattening of nearly everything also metaphorically suggests the scorched-earth effect of wrath – it “alters” the harmonious landscape into charred remains. _(Genres/Contexts: In **modern orchestral** and **metal music**, this kind of heavy chromatic tension is used for berserk or apocalyptic scenes. Jazz uses the altered scale for color, but in a wrath context we hear it more as pure aggression – imagine the chaotic orchestration in scenes of divine wrath or a furious battle, where chords bristling with notes (often interpreted as ♭5, ♭9, etc.) depict unbridled rage.)_

16. **Hostility** – _Definition:_ Hostility is a state of **persistent aggression and antagonism** toward others – not just momentary anger, but an ongoing readiness to fight or oppose. It’s characterized by ill-will and a confrontational attitude.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Phrygian Dominant Mode** (same as used for sadism above – a scale known for its aggressive, “Eastern” flair).
    _Default Progression:_ **I–♭II–♭VII–♭II** (e.g., in B♭ Phrygian dominant: B♭ major – C♭(B) major – A♭ minor – C♭ major).
    _Rationale:_ Whereas we used Phrygian dominant for the sadist’s pleasure, here we harness its fiery side to illustrate constant aggression. The mode’s inherent tension (the clash of a major I with a ♭2 scale degree) gives it a **threatening, martial** tone. The progression I–♭II–♭VII–♭II sets up an almost looping confrontation: in B♭ Phryg. dom, B♭ to C♭ is a semitone punch (like a musical _snarl_ or provocation), then dropping to A♭ minor (♭VII) adds a guttural minor punch, and back to C♭. The lack of resolution to B♭ in the loop actually enhances the feeling of unresolved conflict – much like a hostile person who **won’t back down** or find closure. The music feels “stuck” in a cycle of tension between the ♭II and ♭VII, symbolizing chronic antagonism. Phrygian dominant is often used in intense, energetic pieces and can easily convey belligerence (it’s common in aggressive guitar riffs for this reason). Here it provides a bold, face-to-face belligerence, with its quasi-military half-step motifs and strong dominant-tonic relationship within the scale (e.g., the pull from A♭ up to B♭). _(Genres/Contexts: This mode appears in **battle music** and intense action cues. Imagine a standoff scene or an arena of constant combat – the Phrygian dominant mode, also heard in some **thrash metal** and **Middle Eastern war drums**, delivers the unyielding, hostile energy to match.)_

17. **Resentment** – _Definition:_ Resentment is a **bitter, persistent indignation** arising from feeling wronged or unfairly treated. It’s less explosive than wrath, but it smolders – a long-lived blend of anger, disappointment, and grudging ill-will that can fester over time.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)**.
    _Default Progression:_ **i–♭VII–♭VI–i** (e.g., in C minor: Cm – B♭ major – A♭ major – Cm).
    _Rationale:_ The natural minor (Aeolian) mode is well-suited to sustained negative emotion. Its lack of a raised 7th avoids strong forward motion, which in turn conveys the _stagnation_ of resentment – a feeling of being stuck in bitterness. The chosen progression descends stepwise (C minor -> B♭ -> A♭) before returning to the tonic, mirroring how resentful thoughts often loop on the same grievances. Notably, this is the classic “lament bass” descent (1–♭7–♭6–5) associated with sorrow and bitterness over centuries. Here, applying it in a minor key emphasizes the weight of grudge. The chords B♭ and A♭ (♭VII and ♭VI) provide a somber, heavy backdrop against the more tense C minor. There’s no leading tone to pull us out, so the music settles back into minor – just as resentment finds _no closure_. The emotional tone is dark and brooding, but not flashy – exactly the long, low burn of resentment. _(Genres/Contexts: Frequently used in **melancholic themes** – the minor mode with a descending line is common in tragic film scores when showing a character stewing over past wrongs. Also prevalent in **blues** and certain **ballads**, capturing a sense of unresolved hurt and grudging memory.)_

18. **Dominance (Oppressive Control)** – _Definition:_ In this context, dominance refers to an **intense, malevolent desire to control or subjugate** others. It implies using intimidation, coercion, or violence to establish absolute authority (as seen in tyrants or abusers).
    _Musical Mode:_ **Double Harmonic Major** (Byzantine scale) – **reused** here for its bold, imperial quality.
    _Default Progression:_ **I–♭II–I–♭II** (e.g., in E double harmonic major: E major – F major – E – F…).
    _Rationale:_ The double harmonic major mode’s **intense, march-like** sound lends itself to tyranny and oppression. The progression simply alternating I and ♭II has a grinding, unrelenting feel – much like the boot of an oppressor stepping down repeatedly. In E, the E major to F major clash (1 to ♭2) is dissonant and **forceful**, conveying the idea of imposing one’s will against resistance. Because the progression doesn’t resolve beyond this axis, it creates musical _pressure_. This is deliberate: it’s the harmonic equivalent of “my way or the highway.” The listener is confronted with a wall of major chords moving in half-step – a very authoritarian, processional effect (one might recall Holst’s _Mars_ or other militaristic uses of such motion for domineering vibe). The double harmonic scale also features a major V and leading tone which can be used for resolution, but by focusing on I–♭II here, we emphasize stasis – dominance is maintained, not released. The exotic nature of the scale hints at a grand but cruel empire. Overall, this mode and progression hammer in the feeling of **power and fear**: bright major tonality (power) filled with harsh dissonance (fear). _(Genres/Contexts: Think of **villain marches** or **dictator fanfares** in movies – the strong tonic and foreign-sounding ♭II are common devices. This could underscore scenes of oppression, armies goose-stepping in unison, or any moment where raw power dynamics are on display. The double harmonic major’s historical use in Eastern European and Middle Eastern music also ties to imagery of ancient tyrants or imperial courts enforcing strict control.)_

19. **Jealousy** – _Definition:_ Jealousy is a **fear and anger over potential loss** of something (often a loved one) to a rival. Malicious jealousy, in particular, can lead to violence or extreme actions to prevent or punish perceived unfaithfulness. It’s an insecure, possessive fury, distinct from envy in that the subject feels something _rightfully theirs_ is threatened.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Phrygian Dominant (Spanish Phrygian)** – reused for its passionate, “flamenco” connotation.
    _Default Progression:_ **i–♭VII–♭VI–V** (the classic Andalusian cadence; e.g., in A minor context: Am – G – F – E major).
    _Rationale:_ This progression and mode instantly evoke **fiery passion** and turmoil – fitting for jealousy’s volatile mix of love and hate. The Andalusian cadence (a descending minor progression ending in a major V) is strongly associated with Spanish flamenco drama (think jealous lovers and duels at dawn). Musically, the A Phrygian dominant scale (which is essentially A harmonic minor with a ♭2, capturing the “Spanish gypsy” sound) underpins this sequence: the E major (V) chord’s G♯ is the leading tone that propels the drama back to the minor i (Am), while the F and G chords inject that exotic Phrygian color (A–B♭–C–etc. in the melody against them). This mode has a **swirling, feverish** quality – the half-step from 1 to ♭2 (A to B♭) and augmented step from ♭6 to ♮7 (F to G♯ in the scale) create a push-pull of tension that embodies obsessive emotion. The music rises to E major (the point of maximum tension, analogous to a jealous outburst), then resolves tragically to Am. The cycle repeats, much like jealous suspicions that never fully go away. In sum, Phrygian dominant provides the **ardent intensity** and touch of instability that mirror raging jealousy. *(Genres/Contexts: Heard in **flamenco** and tango music when conveying jealousy and betrayal. Classical composers use this cadence to signify Spain or intense passion (e.g., Bizet’s *Carmen*). In film, whenever a love triangle reaches a breaking point, this musical flavor – dramatic minor with a Phrygian/Spanish twist – can amplify the sense of fatal attraction and impending violence born of jealousy.)*

20. **Misanthropy** – _Definition:_ Misanthropy is a **hatred or deep distrust of humankind** in general. A misanthrope harbors cynicism and disgust toward people at large, often expecting the worst of human nature and shunning society.
    _Musical Mode:_ **Phrygian Mode** (natural minor + ♭2, used again here to emphasize a different shade of darkness).
    _Default Progression:_ **i–♭II–♭VII–i** (e.g., in D Phrygian: Dm – E♭ – C minor – Dm).
    _Rationale:_ Phrygian mode’s gloomy, oppressive aura suits the blanket disdain of misanthropy. However, unlike cruelty (where we used Phrygian for personal harshness), here the focus is on _widespread bleakness_. The progression Dm–E♭–Cm–Dm paints a landscape of despair: the step from Dm to E♭ major (i–♭II) is a gut-punch of dissonance (D against E♭) symbolizing disgust toward humanity. Moving next to C minor (♭VII, adding a relative minor coloration) darkens the mood further – it’s as if the music momentarily sighs in sorrow (C minor) at how awful the world is, before the hate surge (E♭) hits again on the way back to Dm. Ending on the minor tonic without any leading tone confirms the sense of finality and isolation – there is no uplift, no resolution _outside_ the minor key. The Phrygian flatted second also evokes a touch of _“inhumanity”_ in its dissonance, appropriate for rejecting humanity. Together, these elements musically portray a gloomy fortress of solitude and scorn. It’s not loud or quick-tempered; rather, it’s a persistent dark cloud (much as misanthropy is a long-held worldview). _(Genres/Contexts: In **dystopian or post-apocalyptic** game and film scores, a Phrygian palette often underscores the loss of faith in humankind. Also applicable to character themes for loners or antiheroes in drama – the music keeps a hard emotional distance from warmth, enveloping the listener in a kind of cold, soured minor key atmosphere that never quite resolves, just as the misanthrope never finds reconciliation with society.)_
