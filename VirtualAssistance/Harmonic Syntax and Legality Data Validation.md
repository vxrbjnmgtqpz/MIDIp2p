Great. I’ll validate both `syntaxAll.json` and `legalityAll.json`, checking that all chord-role assignments and syntactic combinations are theoretically and modally sound.

The final report will:

* Flag errors or inconsistencies in harmonic function logic.
* Cross-verify chord combinations for modal compatibility.
* Assess overall accuracy and completeness.
* Confirm readiness for integration into your tri-stack architecture.

I’ll let you know once the audit is complete.


# Harmonic Syntax and Legality Data Validation

## Classical – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** The Classical Ionian (major) mode data correctly assigns *I* and its extensions to tonic, *ii/IV* to subdominant, and *V/vii°* to dominant, consistent with standard harmony (I–IV–V functions). The remaining diatonic chords (*iii, vi*) are in “other,” matching theory (iii/vi are tonic-prolongation chords). No obvious mislabels occur (e.g. V only appears under “dominant”).
* **Chord types:** Triads, 7ths, 9ths, sus/aug chords are present in expected categories (e.g. *IM7, IM9* under tonic; *V7, V9* under dominant). Augmented and suspended variants are logically placed (e.g. *V+* under dominant as a chromatic tension chord).
* **Canonicals:** All common diatonic chords are included. In Classical Ionian, *ii–V–I* is implicitly supported (ii goes to V in legality). The legality listing includes all expected transitions (e.g. IV→V→I, V→I, etc.) and no extra improbable pairings.

## Jazz – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Jazz Ionian syntax mirrors Classical (I/IM7 tonic; ii/IV subdominant; V dominant; iii/vi in “other”). This aligns with general harmonic practice. No misplacement of core chords is found.
* **Chord extensions:** Numerous 7ths/9ths/13ths (e.g. *IM9, I6/9*, *ii9, ii11*, *V7alt, V13*) are listed in logical functions. Suspended variants (e.g. *I^sus4*, *ii^sus4*) also appear appropriately. Augmented dominants (*V+*, *I#5*, etc.) reflect jazz’s chromatic usage.
* **Legality issues:** One notable omission: the legality list for Jazz Ionian lacks a direct *ii → I* transition. In practice, the common **ii–V–I** progression is fundamental in jazz, so *ii* should typically resolve to *I* (tonic). Its absence is anomalous. For example, *ii7* only lists dominants and itself as targets, not *I*. This appears incomplete relative to idiomatic progression.
* **Readiness:** Otherwise, Jazz Ionian data is internally consistent. All chords in legality have matching syntax entries. Aside from the missing *ii→I* link, no illegal progressions are flagged.

## Blues – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** The Blues Ionian data extends the major scale with characteristic “blue” chords. It places ♭III and ♭VI (borrowed from parallel minor) under tonic/subdominant, and ♭VII under dominant. This reflects blues practices (e.g. I–IV–♭III–I progressions). No major function mislabels are evident; for instance, *I7* is tonic-typed (since blues I often uses dominant-7), and *♭III7* appears in tonic extensions.
* **Chord types:** 7th and 9th chords (e.g. *I7, I9, IV7, V9*) are used liberally, consistent with blues; suspended chords appear (e.g. *Isus4, IVsus4*). The use of augmented chords (e.g. *IV+*, *V+*, *♭II+* in “other”) is unusual: augmented IV/V chords are rare in classic blues and may be overextended here. In particular, “**♭II+**” (Neapolitan augmented) under “other” is not a standard blues chord and might be spurious.
* **Legality issues:** The allowed transitions include many blues staples (I→IV, IV→V, etc.). No glaring illegal pairings are found. The list even includes e.g. I7→♭VII7 (a common rock/blues move). All legality chords correspond to syntax entries. The only minor oddity: the legality set is dense, but nothing fundamentally impossible is admitted.
* **Justification:** Blues harmony often uses “borrowed” chords like ♭III and ♭VI as tonic-ish chords, so their inclusion here is justified. The extra augmented chord choices may be overzealous. Overall, aside from a couple non-standard entries, the Blues Ionian data is stylistically coherent.

## Pop – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Pop Ionian syntax correctly tags I (and extensions), ii/IV as subdominant, V as dominant, with iii/vi “other.” No misplacements (e.g. no V under tonic). Extended chords (*Iadd9, IVadd9, Vadd9*) and sus/aug chords (e.g. *Isus4, IV+*) are in plausible categories.
* **Legality:** Pop progressions (I↔IV↔V↔vi etc.) are all supported. The transitions do not include classical ii→I (common in jazz), but Pop often less strictly functional, so this may be acceptable. All chords in legality appear in syntax. No illegitimate moves are apparent.
* **Remarks:** The data aligns with typical pop usage of diatonic chords (e.g. the ubiquitous I–V–vi–IV progression is allowed). No canonical diatonic chord is missing. Readiness for Pop Ionian appears high.

## Rock – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Rock Ionian data is consistent: I as tonic; ii/IV subdominant; V dominant; iii/vi other. (Rock often de-emphasizes ii, but it is included.) Triads, 7ths (I7, V7), add9, sus, aug chords appear as expected. No obvious mislabels.
* **Legality:** The legality allows standard rock progressions (I–IV, I–V, IV–V–I, etc.). For example, *I7* can move to IV7 or V7; *IV7* can move to V7 or I – all sensible. No illegal jumps (like V → ii) are listed. All chords in legality exist in syntax.
* **Remarks:** Rock usage of ♭VII is common, but here ♭VII is not present in Ionian Rock (only in Blues/RnB modes). If a rock genre wanted Mixolydian influence, that would belong under Mixolydian mode. As given, Rock Ionian is self-consistent.

## Folk – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Folk (a broad category) shows Ionian functions similar to classical. It includes standard chords (I, ii, IV, V, vi). Tonic (I/I7), subdominant (ii, IV), dominant (V), other (iii, vi) all make sense.
* **Legality:** Folk often uses diatonic progressions; the legality data includes typical moves (ii→V→I, IV→I, etc.). No forbidden transitions appear. The data seems complete: all chords in legality are in syntax.
* **Remarks:** Readiness is good. (One could note that Folk often includes I–IV and I–V, both supported.)

## RnB – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** R\&B Ionian mirrors Jazz/Pop: I tonic, ii/IV subdominant, V dominant, iii/vi other. It adds lush extensions (I6, ii13, V7alt, etc.), which are appropriate. No function mislabels.
* **Legality:** The transitions include extended and chromatic R\&B moves (e.g. *ii9* can go to V7alt, *IM7#11* in tonic flows to V7). No obviously absurd pairings. All legality chords have syntax entries.
* **Remarks:** Given R\&B’s harmonic complexity, the presence of many upper-structure chords is sensible. The data passes consistency checks.

## Cinematic – Ionian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Cinematic Ionian syntax is standard (I tonic with maj7/#11; ii/IV subdominant; V dominant; iii/vi/vii° other). The inclusion of chords like *ii7b5* (a half-diminished supertonic) and unusual sus variants suggests a cinematic color, but not incorrect.
* **Legality:** Transitions allow both classical (I–V–I) and modal moves. No self-contradictions. Each chord in legality appears in syntax.
* **Remarks:** Cinematic progressions often use extended dominants and suspended chains; this data includes those (e.g. *V7sus4*, *Vsus2*). All appears coherent.

## Classical – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** In Dorian, the tonic is *i*. The syntax correctly lists *IV* (major) and *ii* as subdominants, and *v* (minor) plus *bVII* (major) as dominants, echoing modal practice. For example, *IV* (the raised sixth degree gives a major chord) is marked subdominant, matching theory. No mode-incompatible chords appear (no unmodal accidentals).
* **Legality:** The allowed progressions include modal staples (e.g. *i–IV–v–i*, *i–bVII–i*). All legality chords exist in syntax. A possible omission: Jazz-style ii–V–i (with *V* minor) is less relevant in pure Dorian. No fatal issues.
* **Remarks:** This aligns with modal harmony: the minor *v* chord is used instead of a major V, and *bVII* is given a dominant-type role. Everything is consistent with Dorian theory.

## Jazz – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Jazz Dorian data has *i, ii, IV, v, bIII, bVII, vi* in sensible roles. The presence of *bIII7/9* and *vi7* in “other” reflects modal color. Dominant section includes *v7* and *bVII7*, matching the idea that in Dorian a major ♭VII can act dominantly. No clear mislabels.
* **Legality:** Transitions permit typical Dorian usages (i to IV to v to i, bVII as an alternative dominant back to i). All transitions are modal-appropriate. No illegal sequences found. All chords are cross-consistent with syntax.
* **Remarks:** The syntax places the raised-6 harmony correctly (IV major) and treats the minor v as dominant, aligning with theory. No anomalies are seen.

## Blues – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Blues Dorian (similar to Aeolian with raised 6) is a niche; the data lists *i, ii, IV, v, bIII, bVII, vi*. This looks consistent. The use of ♭VII and v as dominants follows modal practice.
* **Legality:** Transitions cover plausible modal-blues moves. We see no illegal chords or missing essentials (i can move to IV, v, bVII as expected).
* **Remarks:** Because Blues often mixes minor modes, the Dorian listing is plausible (IV major subdominant, v minor dominant). No red flags.

## Folk – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Folk Dorian syntax includes *i, ii, IV, v, bIII, bVII, vi*. This is theoretically sound (ii minor, IV major, v minor, ♭III/♭VII major). No out-of-mode chords.
* **Legality:** The progressions (i–IV–v–i, etc.) are supported. No obvious missing links or illegal hops.
* **Remarks:** Matches typical Dorian usage (e.g. i–IV–i sequence). Everything aligns with expectation.

## RnB – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Similar to Jazz Dorian, with rich seventh/9th chords on each. Functions are labeled consistently.
* **Legality:** Allowed sequences cover modal progressions (i ↔ v, use of bVII, etc.). No invalid moves appear.
* **Remarks:** R\&B modal touches (like bVII7 dominants) are captured. Data is consistent.

## Cinematic – Dorian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Cinematic Dorian lists *i, ii, IV, v, bIII, bVII*, all fitting Dorian. No errant chords.
* **Legality:** Cinematic often uses modal cadences; the legality allows i–IV–bVII–i etc. No suspicious entries.
* **Remarks:** All good.

## Classical – Phrygian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Phrygian syntax uses *i, bII, bIII, iv, v, bVI, bVII*. The presence of *bII (major)* as subdominant is characteristic of Phrygian (the “Phrygian half cadence” often moves bII→i). *v* (minor) and *bVII* in dominant reflects modal practice. No obvious misplacement.
* **Legality:** Transitions permit *bII→i* and *iv→bVII*, typical in Phrygian. Nothing impossible stands out. All chords match syntax.
* **Remarks:** The listing conforms to Phrygian theory (emphasizing the flat 2nd). No issues noted.

## Blues – Phrygian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Blues Phrygian is exotic; syntax has *i, iv, bII, bVII, bIII, bVI*. These are plausible if blending phrygian color. *bII/iv* as subdominant, *bVII/v* as dominant, looks consistent.
* **Legality:** Allowed moves include the typical *bII→i* Phrygian cadence and other modal shifts. All legal chords exist in syntax.
* **Remarks:** No obvious contradictions; the data is internally consistent for a Phrygian context.

## Classical – Lydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Lydian syntax has *I, II, iii, IV, vi, vii, #IV°*. Here, *I* is tonic; *ii, #iv°* are subdominant (the raised 4th appears as a diminished chord #IV°, correct for Lydian); *V, vii* are dominant. (*#IV°* appears as a “suspended” entry, which is unusual notation, but likely means the chord on the raised 4th is diminished – Lydian’s #4 triad is indeed diminished.)
* **Legality:** Progressions allow I–V–I and modal flows (IV♮ from the major scale is listed under other). No illegal leaps. All chords have syntax entries.
* **Remarks:** Data matches Lydian’s raised-4th flavor. No mislabels noted.

## Blues – Lydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Blues Lydian (rare) lists *I, ii, III, IV, V, vi, #IV°*. It mixes normal major (I, IV, V) with raised-4 (#IV°) and III. This is unconventional; Blues rarely uses pure Lydian. The inclusion of *#IV°* (augmented/diminished chord on 4th) seems forced.
* **Legality:** Given the odd setup, the transitions are unclear, but each chord appears in syntax so no cross-consistency issues.
* **Remarks:** This data is unusual; true modal Lydian content in blues is questionable. Flag: The #IV° (“augmented 4th” chord) in a Blues context has no clear justification.

## Classical – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Mixolydian syntax lists *I, ii, iii, IV, v (minor), vii°*. This is sensible: Mixolydian is like major with b7, so *v* appears instead of V (v minor, as dominant-like), and *VII* isn’t listed because the scale’s 7th is b7 (giving *vii°* diminished). I, ii, IV in correct functions. No mislabel.
* **Legality:** Common Mixolydian progressions (I–vii°–I, ii–v, etc.) are present. All chords have matching syntax.
* **Remarks:** Consistent with Mixolydian theory (dominant chord lacks a leading tone).

## Jazz – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Jazz Mixolydian is basically major with b7. Syntax has I, ii, iii, IV, v (minor), vi, vii°. Looks like it includes VI (major) under “other,” which is diatonic (major 6th in Mixolydian scale). All placements are modal-correct.
* **Legality:** Transitions allow typical dominant/cadence movements. No improper pairings appear.
* **Remarks:** Correct for a jazz setting (e.g. using iim7–V7).

## Pop – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Pop Mixolydian shows *I, ii, iii, IV, vi, vii* with dominants as minor *v* and *bVII*. This is slightly odd: it omits any listing for *vii°* or a second D7 chord. But it includes *bVII* (major) in dominant, which is modal Mixolydian feature.
* **Legality:** Main progressions (I–bVII–I, etc.) are allowed.
* **Remarks:** The data seems to use *bVII* as a dominant substitute, which is fine. Possibly missing a vi chord (present) or vii° (not in Mixolydian). No glaring errors.

## Rock – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Rock Mixolydian has *I, II, iii, IV, VI, vii* with dominants *V (minor)* and *bVII (major)*. The inclusion of II/II7 in subdominant is stylistic (a D chord in C Mixolydian). *VI* under “other” is C Mixolydian’s minor sixth, correct.
* **Legality:** Transitions include rock staples (I–bVII, IV–I, etc.). Consistent.
* **Remarks:** Matches rock usage of the ♭7. No mislabels noted.

## Folk – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Folk Mixolydian data (I, ii, IV, V, VI, bVII). Similar to Rock. Seems coherent: V minor, bVII major as dominants.
* **Legality:** Folk progressions ok.
* **Remarks:** Fine.

## RnB – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** R\&B Mixolydian includes *I, ii, IV, vi, vii°*; dominants *v (minor), bVII*. Looks correct (Absence of a major V reflects b7).
* **Legality:** Transitions allow modal moves.
* **Remarks:** Good.

## Cinematic – Mixolydian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Cinematic Mixolydian lists *I, ii, iii, IV, VI, VII* (all diatonic, with vii° absent). V only minor. All plausible.
* **Legality:** Cinematic often uses plagal/modal cadences; allowed moves reflect that.
* **Remarks:** Acceptable.

## Classical – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Classical Aeolian (natural minor) places *i* tonic; *ii°/iv* subdominant; *v (minor)/bVII* dominant; *bIII/bVI* other. This fits natural minor (no leading tone).
* **Canonicals:** One important note: the classical minor often uses a **major V** (from harmonic minor) for functional dominant. This Aeolian section has no major V (it lists only *v* minor). Thus *V* (major) is “missing” here, but it appears in the separate HarmonicMinor dataset.
* **Legality:** As written, progressions using minor v are permitted (v→i, etc.). No contradictions.
* **Remarks:** Strictly Aeolian, the absence of a major V (or V7) is expected. The data is correct for a pure natural-minor context.

## Pop – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Pop Aeolian syntax includes both *iv* (minor) **and IV** (major) under subdominant. This is inconsistent with modal Aeolian, where **iv is minor**. The major IV chord (with raised 6th) does not belong in natural Aeolian; it reflects Lydian/modal borrow. This appears to be an error or a deliberate modal mix. Similarly, *V* (major) is included under dominant, contrary to pure Aeolian (v should be minor) – again a modal alteration.
* **Legality:** Transitions list *ii°/iv/IV* as preludes to dominants. The inclusion of IV and V (major) means the legality admits progressions (like major IV→i, V→i) that aren’t Aeolian-canonical.
* **Issues:** **Flagged:** The presence of major IV and V in an “Aeolian” section is theoretically inconsistent. In strict Aeolian, IV should be iv (minor) and V should be v (minor). These may be borrowed or errors.

## Rock – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Rock Aeolian has *i, bII (major), bIII, iv, v, bVI, bVII*. No major IV or V appears (aside from the native chords). This is consistent with natural minor.
* **Legality:** Includes modal cadences (bII→i, iv→bVII, etc.). No disallowed moves.
* **Remarks:** Good.

## Folk – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Folk Aeolian similarly uses *i, bII, bIII, iv, v, bVI, bVII*. All align with Aeolian.
* **Legality:** Standard Aeolian transitions allowed.
* **Remarks:** Correct.

## RnB – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** R\&B Aeolian includes both *iv* and **IV** under subdominant (like Pop). This again conflicts with pure Aeolian (IV major is non-Aeolian). It also lists *V* (major) in dominant and minor *v*. Having both *V* and *v* here mixes modes (harmonic minor influence).
* **Issues:** **Flagged:** The dual appearance of *IV* and *iv*, plus major *V*, is non-modal. These suggest either erroneous entries or cross-modal borrowing.

## Cinematic – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Cinematic Aeolian also lists both *IV* (major) and *iv* (minor) in subdominant. This duplicates the Pop/RnB anomaly. It also allows both *V* and *v* in dominant.
* **Issues:** **Flagged:** Similar to Pop Aeolian, the coexistence of *IV* (major IV) with *iv* is theoretically inconsistent with Aeolian.

## Blues – Aeolian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Blues Aeolian shows *i, bIII, bVI, IV, v, bVII*. It includes *IV* (major) – again not strictly Aeolian – but blues often mixes modes. It treats *bIII, bVI, bVII* as “other,” which is plausible.
* **Legal:** Blues style can combine Aeolian and Dorian; the legality is not obvious but no glaring errors.
* **Remarks:** Acceptable given blues’ modal fluidity.

## Classical – Locrian Mode

* **Function assignments:** Locrian syntax has *i°* as tonic (diminished i), *iv, bVI* subdominant, *bV, bVII* dominant. This is odd: Locrian scale has no perfect 5th, so any “dominant” is dubious. They put *bV (which is the flat-5 chord in Locrian) as dominant.* This is nonstandard since Locrian lacks any true dominant.
* **Legality:** Minimal, reflecting Locrian instability.
* **Issues:** Locrian chords inherently lack strong function; categorizing *bV* or *bVII* as dominant is tenuous. But given Locrian’s rarity, the data may simply list what it has.
* **Remarks:** Locrian is inherently dissonant; the mapping here is approximate.

## Jazz, Pop, Rock, Folk, RnB, Cinematic – Locrian Mode

* **Function assignments:** These genres include Locrian with i° tonic, iv/bVI subdominant, bV/bVII dominant. All place the diminished i as tonic (unusual but understandable for Locrian).
* **Issues:** Similar to Classical: Locrian harmony is theoretical, so syntax is not “wrong” as there’s no standard model. We note no overt contradictions (each listed chord is in the scale).

## Classical – Harmonic Minor Mode

* **Function assignments:** Listed *i, ii°, iv, V, vii°, bIII, bVI*. This matches harmonic minor (major V, diminished ii° and vii°). Dominant includes *V* and *vii°*, correct.
* **Remarks:** Data aligns with theory.

## Classical – Melodic Minor Mode

* **Function assignments:** Listed *i, ii, iv, V, vii°*, with *bIII*, *vi*. Melodic minor (ascending) has major 6 & 7; Dominant V used. It looks mostly consistent.
* **Remarks:** Fine for completeness.

## Readiness Assessment

Overall, **the data is largely coherent and complete**. For standard tonal and modal contexts, chords are placed appropriately and legal progressions are supported. No cross-file inconsistencies were found (every chord in legality appears in syntax). The key issues flagged are genre/mode-specific exceptions:

* In *Aeolian mode* for Pop, RnB, Cinematic, the inclusion of major IV (and V) is inconsistent with strict Aeolian. These may be intentional modal borrowings or mistakes.
* The Jazz Ionian legality lacks the common *ii→I* resolution.
* Blues Ionian’s use of bII+ (augmented bII) is nonstandard.
* *Locrian* function labeling is inherently speculative.

Apart from these, no major errors were detected. Core modal and functional assignments match music theory references. Therefore, **the syntaxAll.json and legalityAll.json data appear accurate and sufficiently complete** for integration, with only minor anomalies as noted. These can be reviewed or fine-tuned before deployment, but no fundamental structural flaws are present.

**Sources:** The harmonic functions are validated against standard theory, and blues modal chords against common practice. The augmented chord usage is informed by practice (often dominant-function), and Aeolian triads by scale definitions.
