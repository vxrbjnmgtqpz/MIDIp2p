Great, Tim. I’ll analyze the chord progression database to identify emotional inconsistencies, focusing on two key areas:

1. Whether each progression’s emotional character aligns with its assigned target emotion.
2. Whether the chords used in each progression still support that emotion based on the updated individual chord emotional mappings we previously reviewed.

I’ll deliver a report that lists all problematic progressions, explains the specific mismatches, and proposes fixes where needed. I’ll also include summaries for quick reference.


# Joy

* **joy\_008 (I–iii–IV–V)** – Includes a **iii** chord (minor mediant) which carries a somber tone (Joy weight 0, high Sadness). This minor chord undercuts the uplifting Ionian mood. *Suggestion:* Replace **iii** with a more upbeat chord (e.g. **ii** or **vi** with supporting instrumentation) or ensure a quick resolution back to **I**, to maintain a consistently joyful feel.
* **joy\_009 (I–V–vi–iii–IV–I–ii–V)** – Uses multiple minor chords (**vi** and **iii**) that skew sad (vi has Sadness 0.7). The sequence feels more bittersweet than purely happy. *Suggestion:* Consider reassigning this progression to a “Love” or nostalgic category, or swap out one minor chord (e.g. use **ii** in place of **iii**) to lighten the emotional tone and better support “Joy.”
* **joy\_011 (I–vi–ii–V)** – The **vi** chord (relative minor) brings a strong melancholy streak (Sadness-heavy), and **ii** is also somewhat wistful. Together they dilute the bright optimism of “Joy.” *Suggestion:* Use **IV** instead of **vi** (I–**IV**–ii–V) for a warmer, more hopeful progression, or classify this progression under a mixed-emotion category (e.g. “Trust”) since it leans sentimental rather than purely joyful.

# Sadness

* **sad\_003 (i–♭VII–♭VI–♭VII)** – Ends on **♭VII** (major chord). The G major chord (♭VII in Aeolian) injects a hint of resolution and even anticipation, undermining the “emotional gravity” of sadness. *Issue:* Major ♭VII here sounds slightly too hopeful. *Suggestion:* Resolve back to **i** (A minor) instead of lingering on ♭VII, or use ♭VII only as a passing chord so the progression concludes in the darker tonic minor, preserving the melancholy mood.
* **sad\_007 (i–iv–i–♭VII)** – Similarly closes on a **♭VII** major chord (G) rather than returning to **i**. This ending on a brighter major chord adds an unexpected lift (Surprise \~0.4, Joy \~0.2 on G) that conflicts with a “low energy, despairing” vibe. *Suggestion:* Finish on **i** (or even on **iv** before resolving to i) to maintain an unresolved, mournful feeling. If ♭VII is desired for color, follow it with **i** so the progression ends in sadness instead of an ambiguous brightness.
* **(Overall)** – Most **Sadness** progressions use minor chords and modal degrees (♭VI, ♭III) that appropriately convey melancholy. The few instances of strong major resolution (as above) are the main inconsistencies. Ensuring each progression cadence lands on a minor or diminished chord will better support the introspective, sorrowful character of this category.

# Trust

* **trust\_009 (i–IV–vi°–ii)** – Contains a **vi°** (diminished vi) chord, which is highly dissonant and associated with fear/shame (Fear weight \~0.7). This jarring chord undercuts the “grounded, supportive” feel of Trust, introducing unnecessary anxiety. *Suggestion:* Replace **vi°** with a more consonant chord. For example, in D Dorian context, using **V** or **♭VII** in place of the B° will preserve forward motion without the fear-laden dissonance. This keeps the progression warm and stable in support of trust.
* **trust\_004 (i–IV–ii–♭VII)** – Ends on **♭VII** (C major in D Dorian). While ♭VII adds color, it carries little direct “trust” sentiment (Dorian ♭VII has Love/Surprise tones, Trust \~0.0). The progression feels unsettled by finishing on a non-tonic major chord. *Suggestion:* Resolve the ♭VII to **i** at the end (i–IV–ii–♭VII–**i**), or use **v** (A minor) instead of ♭VII as the final chord. Either change would bring the progression back to a more resolved, gentle ending consistent with an intimate, supportive mood.
* **(Overall)** – Trust progressions are mostly consistent (plenty of minor i–iv movements and gentle major IV chords). The main flags are the use of strongly unstable chords (diminished or non-resolution endings) that stray from the “softly hopeful” character. Emphasizing diatonic minor chords and resolving to **i** will ensure internal consistency.

# Love

* **love\_003 (I–♭VII–v–I)** – The inclusion of a **v** (minor dominant, e.g. Dm in G Mixolydian) injects a note of sadness (in C Ionian terms, Dm has notable Sadness weight and only minimal Love). This can make the progression feel more wistful than tender. *Suggestion:* Use a major V chord (borrow from the parallel major key) to strengthen the resolution back to I. For instance, G Mixolydian could use D major (**V**) instead of Dm – adding a touch of brightness and “soulful warmth” while reducing the somber undertone.
* **love\_005 (I–♭VII–IV–v)** – This progression ends on the **v** minor chord (here, Dm) without returning to I, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy/unresolution. While Mixolydian’s flattened 7th and minor V create a nostalgic vibe, ending on a minor chord drags the mood toward sorrowful. *Suggestion:* Follow the **v** with **I** to conclude on a warmer, more resolved note (so the listener feels the “familiar, tender” resolution). Alternatively, in contexts where ending on v is stylistic, ensure that earlier measures emphasize **I** and **IV** enough that the overall tone remains affectionate rather than morose.
* **(Overall)** – The **Love** progressions appropriately use the ♭VII and other Mixolydian colors to impart a soulful nostalgia. The primary inconsistency arises when a progression leans too heavily into minor chords (ii or v) without resolution. Keeping a balance – e.g. resolving minor chords to major I or IV – will align each progression more closely with a warm, loving feel.

# Surprise

* **(All Progressions)** – The **Surprise** progressions (Lydian mode) consistently leverage the mode’s signature unexpected chords (e.g. **II** major and even ♯IV°) to create an “optimistic novelty.” They avoid conventional V–I resolutions, so none of the progressions contain chords that obviously contradict the intended emotion. Each chord (even the resolved I major) is colored by the Lydian #4, maintaining an airy, curious quality. *No problematic progressions were found:* the chords chosen logically support the “floating” and “curious” character of Surprise. (For example, a typical Surprise progression I–II–V–I uses **II** instead of the usual ii, which injects a bright unexpected twist without undermining the positivity.)
* *Suggestion:* To preserve internal consistency, continue using **II** and avoid any heavy minor or diminished chords outside the Lydian scale. As currently structured, these progressions align well with the surprise/curiosity target emotion.

# Anger

* **anger\_006 (I–♭III–♭II–I)** – The **♭III** chord (e.g. G major in E Phrygian Dominant) is a somewhat stable major chord that momentarily lessens the intensity. In other contexts G major can even convey uplifting or heroic tones (not ideal for “furious” Anger). *Issue:* This brief “rest” in an otherwise aggressive progression softens the impact. *Suggestion:* Make the ♭III chord more menacing – for example, use a G minor or G⁺ (augmented) chord, or even omit ♭III in favor of a sustained **I** pedal. Altering that chord to a darker quality will better maintain the volatile, forceful feel.
* **anger\_003 (I–V–♭II–I)** – Incorporates a **V** chord (a traditional dominant, e.g. B major in E Phrygian Dominant). While V is part of the Phrygian Dominant scale, as a straight major chord it introduces a sense of tonal resolution. This can momentarily reduce the “instability” that defines anger. *Suggestion:* Consider using **v** (minor v, or even v° if workable) to keep the tension high. Alternatively, accent the V with alterations (e.g. B7 or a b9 extension) to make it more dissonant. Ensuring every chord retains some bite (through minor quality or added dissonances) will keep the progression aligned with explosive aggression.
* **(Overall)** – The Anger progressions effectively use Phrygian Dominant’s inherent tension (♭II and unusual degrees). The only minor flags are instances of **major chords that sound too “resolved.”** Emphasizing diminished, minor, or altered chords (iv°, v°, ♭vii° etc.) in place of any benign major triads will ensure each progression stays consistently aggressive and unstable.

# Fear

* **fear\_010 (i–♭VI–♭VII–i)** – Features a **♭VI** major chord (e.g. C major in E Phrygian). In isolation, C major is a warm, consonant chord (in Ionian context, Joy = 1.0) – the opposite of dread. Here it provides a brief “relief” that undermines the claustrophobic anxiety of Fear. *Suggestion:* Use **♭VI** sparingly or in a more menacing guise. For instance, making it **♭VI** minor (C minor in E Phrygian) or adding a dissonant extension (like an augmented fifth) would keep the chord feeling tense. Ideally, follow ♭VI quickly back to a more unstable chord (♭VII or i) so the progression doesn’t linger on a pleasant harmony.
* **fear\_005 (i–♭II–♭VI–♭VII)** – This progression contains **♭VI** (C major) as well, and moreover it **ends on ♭VII** (D minor in E Phrygian). Ending on a major/minor chord other than the tonic leaves the fear unresolved – which can be effective – but D minor (iv in the relative major) has some emotional ambiguity (mix of sadness and a hint of stability) rather than pure apprehension. *Suggestion:* As above, swap **♭VI** (C major) for a more ominous chord (or diminish it, e.g. C° leading into D). And consider ending on **i** (E minor) or even a **v°** (B° leading tone) to maximize tension. Returning to the tonic i at the very end (even softly) can actually reinforce fear by completing the dark minor resolution.
* **(Overall)** – The Fear progressions successfully leverage the Phrygian mode (especially the shocking **♭II** chord) to create anxiety. The main inconsistency is the use of **♭VI** major, a chord which on its own is associated with more positive or heroic feelings. Keeping the focus on the half-step dissonances (i–♭II, or v°–i) and using predominantly minor or diminished chords will ensure each progression stays internally spooky and taut.

# Disgust

* **disgust\_004 (♭v–i°–♭VI–♭II)** – The **♭VI** chord here (in B Locrian, ♭VI would be G major) is surprisingly consonant. In the Locrian context, G major has no tritone against the bass and carries emotional hints of sorrow or even warmth (Shame \~0.5, Love \~0.3), rather than the “repelling” quality we expect. Its appearance mid-progression provides a tonal stability that dilutes the overall dissonance. *Suggestion:* Change **♭VI** to **♭vi** minor (G minor) or a diminished chord built on that scale degree, to reintroduce instability. Additionally, this progression ends on **♭II** (C major in B Locrian). While ♭II is an important Locrian chord for tension, ending on a major chord (even an uneasy one like C major over a B bass) grants a bit of resolution. To reinforce the “harmonic collapse” effect, consider ending on **i°** (B diminished) or **♭vii°** – something unresolved – so the listener is left with a broken, unsettled feeling.
* **disgust\_007 (♭II–♭v–♭VI–i°)** – Contains **♭VI** (major) as well, inserted between highly dissonant chords. The F♯→G→A♭ motion (if we assume B♭ Locrian, for example) could actually sound almost melodic. This major ♭VI momentarily eases the tension with a recognizable triad. *Suggestion:* Similar to above, using **♭vi** (minor or diminished) would keep the chord progression consistently “sour.” Overall, ensure any major chords in Locrian progressions are either avoided or immediately destabilized (e.g. by adding a flat 5 or resolving to a dim chord) to maintain the hollow, disoriented atmosphere.
* **(Overall)** – The **Disgust** progressions are filled with diminished chords and tritone leaps that aptly convey nausea and chaos. The one recurring issue is the occasional major chord (♭II or ♭VI) providing too much consonance. Tweaking those to minor/augmented versions or positioning them so they don’t receive emphasis (e.g. not on strong beats or final cadences) will achieve better internal consistency for the disgust emotion.

# Anticipation

* **anticipation\_002 (i–IV–V–i)** – The **IV** chord (e.g. D major in A melodic minor) is fairly stable and uplifting (Trust \~0.7, Joy \~0.5). In a progression about “unresolved hope,” this IV–V sequence momentarily feels almost resolved, like a triumph rather than longing. *Suggestion:* Use a more ambiguous chord in place of **IV** – for instance, **ii°** (B° in A melodic minor) or an altered IV (such as an augmented IV⁺) – to keep the forward-driving tension. By avoiding a plain major IV, the progression maintains more suspense before the V–i resolution.
* **anticipation\_007 (i–♭VI+–ii°–V)** – Generally effective, but note the **♭VI+** (augmented VI) here is very bold. It works for tension (augmented chord = unresolved), yet it has a strong Aesthetic Awe component (augmented C chord in A minor has Awe \~0.8) which might verge more on “sublime” than “hopeful.” This isn’t so much a logical inconsistency as an emotional nuance: it adds grandeur that could shift the mood. *Suggestion:* This is likely acceptable, but if the goal is a simpler “longing,” one might use ♭VI (F major) or iv instead and save the ♭VI+ for “Awe” progressions.
* **(Overall)** – The **Anticipation** progressions do a good job of balancing brightness with tension (e.g. frequent V chords for drive, and the raised leading tone of melodic minor). To maximize the sense of expectant unrest, it’s best to minimize fully resolved moments. The few instances of a calming IV chord or overly majestic augmented chord can be adjusted as noted, keeping the emotional arc climbing and unresolved until the very end.

# Shame

* **shame\_010 (i–♭III+–iv–V)** – Includes a **♭III+** (augmented major III) chord, e.g. Caug in A harmonic minor. This chord brings a sense of the uncanny or “cosmic” (Aesthetic Awe \~0.8, Surprise \~0.7) that can distract from the raw, grief-stricken feel of Shame. While it does convey pain, it does so in an almost grandiose way. *Issue:* The emotional focus shifts from personal sorrow to a more awe-filled drama. *Suggestion:* Use a regular ♭III (C major) or a minor iv°/♭II° in that spot to emphasize tragedy over strangeness. For instance, **i–♭III–iv–V** would still sound haunting and tragic without the extra “lift” of the augmented chord.
* **shame\_002 (i–♭VI–V–i)** – This progression is generally solid, but note the **V** chord (E major in A minor) brings in a leading tone resolution (the classic harmonic minor sound). That leading-tone creates a strong pull to i, which is appropriate, yet E major by itself has a slightly triumphant ring (Anticipation 1.0, a touch of Joy 0.2). *Suggestion:* Ensure the **V** chord is voiced/timed to emphasize its tension (perhaps as V7 or with a dissonant suspension) rather than a glorious V–i cadence. Keeping the dominant feeling “strained” (like a cry that resolves into sobbing on i) will align the progression with Shame’s “heavy, haunted” quality.
* **(Overall)** – The **Shame** progressions effectively use the harmonic minor palette (iv, V, ♭II°, etc.) to convey tragedy. The main consideration is to avoid any chord that sounds too **triumphant or otherworldly**. Augmented chords and very strong major dominants should be handled carefully – they can be used, but must resolve into minor to deliver the gut-punch of shame. Small adjustments as noted help keep each progression’s emotional logic focused on mourning and regret.

# Envy

* **envy\_009 (i–V–♭II–♯iv°)** – Generally captures “twisted desire” well, but the **V** chord (E major in A Hungarian minor) stands out slightly. While V is part of the scale, as a straight major chord it introduces a heroic tension (Anticipation-heavy, Anger 0.4) that leans more triumphant than bitter. It works to build intensity, but could be seen as empowering rather than covetous. *Suggestion:* Add complexity to **V** – for example, use V7 or a Hungarian minor characteristic V (which often includes a ♭9) – to give it an exotic, less straightforward sound. This keeps the tension but adds a slight “twist” of jealousy or unease to the dominant chord.
* **envy\_005 (i–♭III+–♯iv°–V)** – The **♭III+** augmented chord here (e.g. Caug in G Hungarian minor) is rich and dramatic (Awe/Surprise laden). It actually fits the “exotic, intense” vibe of Envy quite well, so it’s not a flaw – rather, it’s a highlight. Just ensure the following diminished chord (♯iv°) and V carry that tension forward without resolving it too nicely. *No critical issues* in this progression; it’s internally consistent but worth noting the augmented chord pushes toward the sublime end of envy’s emotional spectrum.
* **(Overall)** – The **Envy** progressions use Hungarian minor’s tense intervals (♯4 dim, ♭2, etc.) effectively. There are no outright contradictory chords; at most, a plain **V** chord might momentarily sound triumphant. The recommendations are to slightly “taint” any overly clean dominant or major chords with additional tension (diminished extensions, etc.). By doing so, each chord in the progression maintains that sharp, bitter edge characteristic of envy, ensuring coherence with the intended emotion.

# Aesthetic Awe

* **(All Progressions)** – The **Aesthetic Awe** progressions (Lydian Augmented mode) are built on inherently ethereal chords (major chords with raised fifths, augmented dominants, etc.) that evoke the sublime. These chords (e.g. I, II, ♭III⁺) carry strong **Awe** and **Surprise** weightings by design and minimal mundane emotions like Joy or Fear – meaning each chord supports the “transcendent beauty” target emotion well. We did not find any progression using a chord that felt out of place. For example, even a plain major chord **I** in this mode is immediately colored by the #4 and #5 scale tones, lending an elevated, “cosmic” quality rather than simple happiness.
* *Suggestion:* Continue to avoid diatonic minor or dominant chords that resolve too neatly. The current progressions’ use of augmented and Lydian-chromatic tones is internally consistent. Ensuring every progression features some modal ambiguity (e.g. the augmented IV or ♯V degree present) keeps the sense of **Awe** throughout. No corrections needed – the chord sequences under Aesthetic Awe already logically and emotionally reinforce the sublime, reverent mood of this category.
