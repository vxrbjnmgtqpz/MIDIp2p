Audit of Emotional Mapping Accuracy in Chord Database

Ionian Mode Issues
Major triads in Ionian should emphasize positive emotions (joy, trust, love)
themusicstudio.ca
. Most Ionian entries do this (e.g. I and IV with high Joy/Trust), but III (Em in C major) stands out: it has Surprise 0.6 and zero Joy/Trust. In a major key, the III chord is minor, but giving it high Surprise with no joyful weight is counterintuitive. It would be more consistent to reduce Surprise and assign some Sadness or lower-level Trust (to reflect its minor quality) instead. Similarly, the ii chord (Dm) has unusually high Trust (0.6) and Anticipation (0.5) for a minor chord. We suggest lowering Trust and adding more Sadness or lowering overall intensity to better reflect a typical subdominant minor.
Aeolian Mode Issues
In natural minor (Aeolian), triads tend to be darker. The i chord (Am) correctly has dominant Sadness, but its nonzero Trust (0.4) and Love (0.3) are somewhat high for a purely melancholic tonic. The v chord (Em) in Aeolian is minor but is given Anticipation 0.6; however, without a raised 7th it lacks true dominant function, so such high Anticipation feels unsupported. We suggest reducing V (Em) Anticipation and shifting weight to Sadness or Fear. The ♭VII (G major) and ♭III (C major) in A minor are major chords, yet the map gives them no Joy (Joy = 0). Major chords should carry at least modest Joy/Trust
themusicstudio.ca
. For example, G (♭VII) could gain ~0.2 Joy/Trust, reducing Fear/Surprise accordingly. Likewise, C (♭III) should include some Joy. This adjustment aligns with the general “bright” character of major chords

.
Dorian Mode Issues
In Dorian (minor with raised 6th), some mappings seem off. The ii chord (Em) is minor but has Trust 0.6 and zero Sadness. Minor chords normally convey dark/diminished qualities, so Trust that high is counterintuitive
themusicstudio.ca
. We recommend reducing Em’s Trust (e.g. to 0.2–0.3) and adding some Sadness or subtle Fear to better fit its minor function. Other Dorian chords look reasonable: the Dorian V (Am) has moderate Sadness/Fear and Dorian i (Dm) correctly leads with Sadness.
Augmented-Chord Entries
The augmented III chord (♭III+) appears in the Harmonic, Melodic, and Hungarian minor contexts (e.g. Caug). All assign it high Awe (0.8–1.0) but also unusually high Envy (0.5–0.6). Augmented chords are exotic and suspenseful, but “envy” is not a common descriptor for them. Instead, emphasis could shift from Envy to Surprise, Anticipation, or Awe (already high), reflecting their tension and otherworldly feel

. For example, reduce Caug’s Envy weight by 0.3 and raise Surprise or Anticipation by a similar amount. This change would better match the chord’s inherently unstable, suspenseful character.
Jazz Chords and Suspensions
Most jazz chords align well with expectations (e.g. G7 has high Anticipation 0.9, and maj7/min7 carry appropriate warmth or melancholy). One note: Gsus7 (Jazz sus7) is assigned only moderate Trust/Love (0.3). Suspended chords often feel unresolved (Anticipation 0.8 here is good), but since Gsus7 omits the third, it lacks the clear “major” quality. It may not need extra joy, but a slight increase in Surprise (currently 0.6) could underscore its tension. No major corrections needed beyond these minor tweaks.
Blues Context Anomalies
In Blues harmony, several “borrowing” chords seem underspecified. For example, ♭VII (Bb major) and ♭III (Eb major) have no Joy assigned, which clashes with their major quality. We suggest adding some Joy (~0.2–0.3) to these, reducing Surprise or Shame correspondingly. Also, ♭VI (Ab major) has Joy = 0; similarly, give it a small Joy weight. These changes reflect that, even in bluesy/“dark” contexts, major chords carry a hint of warmth or resolution

Harmonic/Melodic/Hungarian Minor Dominants
The V7 chords (e.g. E7 in minor contexts) rightly stress Anticipation (often 0.9–1.0) and some tension (Fear/Anger), which is plausible
greenhillsguitarstudio.com
. However, all such E7 entries have Joy = 0. In practice, a dominant 7th (even in minor) may carry a touch of boldness or enthusiasm. We recommend assigning a low Joy (e.g. 0.1–0.2) or Trust (0.1) to V7 to avoid an unnaturally dour profile. This minor positive flavor would recognize that dominant chords are energetic, not purely menacing, consistent with the V chord’s role of forward motion

.
Locrian Mode Extremes
Locrian is intrinsically unstable, and this is reflected in very high negative weights. For instance, ♭II (Bb major) is given Anger 0.9 and Fear 0.8. But as a major chord, it should carry some residual trust or resolution if context allows. It may be better to tone down Anger (e.g. to 0.6) and include slight Trust (0.2–0.3) or Anticipation, making it less one-dimensionally violent. Similarly, ♭V (Eb major) is Fear 0.9 with Joy = 0; we suggest cutting back Fear a bit and adding low Joy/Trust. ♭VII (G major) has Surprise 0.5 but no Joy; even in Locrian, a major G should evoke at least minimal positivity. Adding ~0.2 Joy and reducing Fear would help. These adjustments ensure major chords, even in extreme modes, reflect their inherently brighter quality
themusicstudio.ca
 rather than being purely negative. Summary of Corrections: In practice, we would revise flagged entries to shift some weight from negative/tense emotions into plausible positives. For example, adding Joy/Trust to major chords that had none (Aeolian ♭VII/C, Blues Bb/Eb/Ab, Locrian ♭II/♭V/♭VII), and lowering unexpected Trust on minor chords (Dorian ii). Similarly, reducing Anticipation on non-dominant v chords (Aeolian v) and replacing Envy on augmented chords with Surprise. These tweaks improve consistency with common harmonic-emotional associations
