# Emotion-to-Chord Progression Mapping

Below is a comprehensive mapping of various **sub-emotions** to a representative **chord progression** that captures the mood. Each progression is chosen based on music theory insights and credible sources. *(Note: Major chords are denoted by capital letters, minor chords by the letter plus “m”, and other chord types are specified as needed.)* Citations are provided to validate the emotional qualities of the chords or progressions.

## Joy & Positive Emotions

* **Cheerful:** A bright, simple major-key progression such as **C – F – G – C** (I–IV–V–I in C major) evokes happiness and energy. This uses only major chords, which are strongly associated with *“happiness, cheerfulness, \[and] brightness”*. In general, *“predictable progressions with major chords reflect contentment and happiness”*, so the classic I–IV–V loop feels upbeat and satisfying.
* **Contentment:** A very stable progression like **C – G – C** (I–V–I) conveys calm satisfaction. Ending on the tonic (I) after the dominant (V) gives a sense of resolution and completeness, matching a content, resolved emotional state. Because major chords and straightforward progressions *“reflect contentment and happiness”*, a simple tonic-dominant return feels peacefully resolved.
* **Optimistic (Hopeful):** A progression featuring an added 9th or sustaining tones suggests openness and hope. For example, **C – G – Am – Fadd9** builds from I to vi and ends on an Fadd9 chord, adding a color tone to a major chord. Such **ninth chords** convey *“openness \[and] optimism”*. The rising motion to the vi chord (Am) and the unresolved added 9th create a feeling of forward-looking expectancy characteristic of hope.

## Love & Romance

* **Romantic (Loving):** Lush, soft chords with gentle resolutions fit a loving mood. A classic romantic progression is **C – Am – F – G7** (I–vi–IV–V⁷) often used in love songs (the "50s progression"). This blends major and minor chords, moving from the warm C major to its relative minor (Am) for a bittersweet touch, then resolving through F to a G⁷ dominant. Major seventh chords can also add a dreamy quality – for example **Cmaj7 – Gmaj7 – Am7 – Fmaj7** yields rich harmony. Major 7ths are literally described as evoking *“romance, softness, ... serenity”*. Overall, the I–vi–IV–V progression gives a nostalgic, heartfelt feeling, suitable for love.

## Sadness & Grief

* **Melancholy (Gently Sad):** A minor-key progression with a touch of unresolved tension captures gentle sadness. **A minor – F – G – E** (vi–IV–V–V/V in C major; i–♭VI–♭VII–V in A minor) is an example. The move from Am to F and G gives a wistful, longing sound, and ending on the E major (V in Am) instead of resolving back to Am leaves a hint of yearning. Minor chords naturally convey *“sadness, melancholy, darkness”*, and the inclusion of the major V (E major in A minor) adds a glimmer of tension that feels like longing or regret.
* **Sad / Sorrowful:** A descending progression in a minor key often signifies deep sadness. For instance, **A minor – G – F – E (Am)** is a common sorrowful sequence (i–VII–VI–V in A minor). The stepwise descent (A→G→F→E in the bass) mirrors a sighing, downward motion. Such progressions were famously used in classical pieces (e.g. Pachelbel’s Canon’s relative minor variation) and pop ballads, and they *“signal sadness right away”*. The minor tonic and submediant (F) especially reinforce the *“sullen, depressing”* tone of sadness.
* **Grief (Despair):** An extended minor progression with unexpected chords can represent intense despair. For example, **A minor – G – F – Am – Eⁿ – F – Gsus4 – G** (as suggested for “mourning”) travels through a longer phrase, heightening the emotional journey. The progression starts in somber Am, dips to the subdominant (F) and back, then introduces an E major (Eⁿ) for a harsh leading-tone pull, and finally rises through F to a suspended G resolving to G major. The use of the *suspended 4th (Gsus4 resolving to G)* provides *“delightful tension”* even in a grieving context – the temporary refusal to resolve mirrors the pain of loss before a final acceptance on G. Overall, heavy use of minor and diminished tones here paints a picture of anguish.
* **Nostalgic (Bittersweet):** A progression that blends major and minor can evoke nostalgia – sad but with warmth. A quintessential example is the **C – A minor – F – G** doo-wop progression (I–vi–IV–V in C). This `50s progression` is known to *“evoke some classy sadness and nostalgia”*. The shift from C major to its relative minor (Am) gives a bittersweet feeling (happy memories tinged with sadness), and the strong resolution back to C via F–G feels like fond remembrance. Nostalgia in music often comes from this interplay of major and minor, capturing mixed emotions.

## Anger & Aggression

* **Frustrated (Annoyed):** A progression that builds tension without immediate release suits frustration. Using suspended chords that resolve into a minor chord can achieve this. For example, **Dsus2 – Dsus4 – Dm** repeatedly elevates the tension on D (adding 2nd then 4th) before dropping into D minor. This *“Suspended Storm”* style progression *“builds anticipation and unresolved tension before finally resolving to a minor chord”*, mirroring a rising irritation that finally snaps. The suspended chords create an anxious, unsettled feel (appropriate for annoyance), and when the chord resolves to minor, it’s like the frustration has burst through briefly.
* **Angry:** A minor progression with a downward or unresolved movement captures anger’s dark, brooding quality. **A minor – Dm – Gm** (i–iv–v in A minor, ending on an unresolved v chord) is one such *“Classic Minor Downfall”* progression *“moving from Am to Dm to Gm”* that *“perfectly reflects the essence of anger”*. Each chord adds layers of tension: all three are minor (sadness and tension inherent), and the sequence descends in tonal center (A down to G by way of Dm) which can feel like sinking deeper into anger. Ending on Gm (the v chord unresolved to the i) leaves a sense of unrest – exactly how anger often feels unresolved.
* **Rage (Enraged):** For full-blown rage, dissonance and unstable chords are key. A progression like **C minor – G⁰ – Dm** (i – v° – iv in C minor, where G° is the diminished chord on the dominant) exemplifies this intensity. In this *“Diminished Drive”* progression, the diminished chord *“introduces a sharp, biting tension… amplifying the anger conveyed”*. Diminished chords are formed of stacked minor thirds and are inherently unstable; in fact, the diminished chord is often cited as *“the darkest chord in music”*. By wedging a fully diminished chord between minor chords, the music conveys volatility and fury. The listener feels no safe resolution, only a driving, relentless tension – much like the rush of rage itself.

## Fear & Tension

* **Anxious (Nervous):** A jarring progression that oscillates or never settles can represent anxiety. For instance, **G minor – A♭/G – Gm – A♮/G** (alternating Gm with an A major chord over a G bass) creates an uneasy rocking motion. This is similar to a *“thriller/suspense”* pattern used in soundtracks. The bass stays on G, but the chords above shift between G minor and an A major (which is a half-step higher root). That major chord over the static bass introduces a dissonant major second interval (G against A in the harmony), generating a *suspenseful, worried* feel. The music feels stuck in a loop of tension – much like the looping worry of anxiety.
* **Afraid (Fearful):** A progression featuring a **diminished chord** captures fear and dread. For example, **A minor – B° – E (or A minor)** is effective (here B° is the diminished chord built on the 2nd scale degree of A minor, leading to either E major or back to Am). Diminished chords are famously associated with *“fear, shock, spookiness, \[and] suspense”*. In this progression, Am establishes a dark mood, the B° chord (built on the unstable tritone from the scale) spikes the tension with its dissonant, unstable tone, and then resolving to E major (the dominant of Am) leaves a hanging feeling that another cycle will repeat (unresolved to Am directly). The net effect is an unresolved ominous atmosphere – we sense fear of something lurking, as the music never fully “comes home” to safety.
* **Terrified (Horrified):** Extreme fear can be conveyed by relentlessly dark, chromatic chord movement. For instance, **E♭m – D° – F° – E♭m** (a progression from a drill music example) is *“the darkest of them all, thanks to some grim-sounding diminished chords”*. Here the tonal center shifts by **chromatic** steps: E♭ minor to D diminished to F diminished and back to E♭m. The diminished chords are packed with dissonance (diminished = stacked minor 3rds) and moving them in half-step relations maximizes the tension. This feels chaotic and nightmarish – as one might feel in terror. Another approach is a “danger motif” like **Fm – E♭m/F – Fm – F♯m/F**, which keeps an F pedal tone while sliding the chord underneath from F minor to E♭ minor and then to F♯ minor. The clashing semitone (F vs F♯) and sudden shifts produce a spine-chilling discord. In sum, heavy use of dissonant/diminished chords and chromatic motion portrays raw terror.

## Disgust & Aversion

* **Disgust (Repulsed):** Music conveying disgust often uses clashing, unsettling harmonies that push the listener away. A good example is a dominant seventh with a flattened ninth, which has a very tense sound. For instance, **B⁷♭9 resolving to Em** can sound unsettling and “wrong.” A C7♭9 chord in isolation is described as evoking *“creepiness, ominousness”* – those same qualities align with a feeling of disgust or distrust. In a progression, the C7♭9 (for example) could lead to an Fm chord, never giving the expected resolution (C7 normally resolves to F major, but resolving to F minor or another unexpected chord keeps it uneasy). The dissonant interval between the root and the flatted 9th in the chord creates a nausea-inducing clash. By using such a chord, the music instills an uneasy, queasy tension in the listener – much like the feeling of disgust.
* **Loathing (Hatred):** For an extreme aversion or loathing, we combine dissonance with heavy, dark resolution. A progression like **B minor – Caug – Dm** is illustrative. This moves from Bm (already dark) to C augmented (C+), then to D minor. The *augmented chord* (C+) contains a raised fifth, which produces a dissonant, unstable sound, heightening tension. In the context above, the augmented C acts like a “wrong” major chord between two minor chords – the result is jarring. The move into Dm after the C+ gives some resolution but not a happy one – it’s a bitter resolution into another minor mood. This kind of progression (resembling the *“Dissonant Dance”* described by one source) *“provides a palpable sense of unease”* and leaves *“a lingering sense of conflict”*. It effectively paints musical loathing: the sound feels conflicted, dark, and unsettled, as if the music itself “hates” where it’s going. (Notably, such chord moves are often used in horror or villain themes, which overlap with feelings of extreme aversion.)

## Surprise & Wonder

* **Shock (Startled):** An abrupt change from minor to major (or vice versa) can musically “startle” the listener, mirroring the feeling of shock. For example, **C minor → C major** (moll-dur shift on the tonic) within a progression is striking. This kind of *“Minor–Major shift”* *“plays with listeners’ expectations by abruptly changing from a minor chord to a major chord,”* which can *“evoke surprise and discomfort”*. One moment the harmony is dark, the next it’s suddenly bright – a musical jump-scare. Another way to induce shock is an unexpected **tritone leap or chord** (since the tritone is historically the “Devil’s interval” known for its unnerving effect). The key is the element of *the unexpected*; as one music psychology expert notes, *“when we hear something dissonant \[or out of place], it gives you a little emotional frisson because it’s strange and unexpected”* – just the effect we get from a sudden chord that doesn’t belong.
* **Amazed (In Awe):** For a sense of awe or astonished wonder, a progression that feels expansive, ethereal, or “magical” is ideal. One such progression is **E minor – C minor** alternating (Em → Cm → Em → Cm …). This was suggested as a “magical” sound. Here the music shifts between two minor chords a major third apart, a type of chromatic mediant relationship that *“disrupts the expected tonality, creating a sense of intrigue”*【24†L226-L234}. The unusual pairing of Em and Cm (no shared key) gives a mystical, otherworldly vibe – as if the music is floating between worlds. This evokes awe and wonder. Another example is **F – B♭ – G♭ – D♭** (all major chords in a non-diatonic sequence), akin to the *“Awe & Wonder”* progression【2†L53-L58】. The bold jumps through distant major chords feel triumphant yet beyond comprehension – much like being awestruck by something larger than life.
* **Mysterious (Enigmatic):** To convey mystery, composers often use modal or chromatic chords that don’t immediately reveal if they are major or minor. A progression like **F minor – A major – Fm – C♯m** is a prime example of *“Mysterious & Tense”* harmony. It starts in F minor (somber), jumps to A major (a startling shift up a major third to a bright chord), then back to Fm and down to C♯ minor (another unexpected shift). These chromatic mediants and mode-mixing chords *“effectively disrupt the diatonic scale, creating a sense of unease and intrigue”*. The listener isn’t sure what key we’re in or where it will go next, which perfectly underscores a feeling of mystery or secrecy. The tension of mystery is thus maintained by avoiding straightforward resolutions and employing unusual chord relationships.
* **Magical (Enchanted):** For a whimsical, enchanted feeling (related to awe but more whimsical), combining major and minor in an unconventional way works well. The earlier **Em ↔ Cm** progression under “Amazed” applies here too – it was explicitly labeled “Magical” for its spellbinding quality. Another trick for a magical vibe is using **Lydian mode** chords (Lydian has a sharpened 4th scale degree that gives a dreamy quality). For instance, in C Lydian, a **C – D (maj II) – G – C** progression uses a D major (II in Lydian) which is outside C major. This raised 4th (F♯ in the context of C) adds a sense of wonder and brightness. Historically, modes like **Lydian** were considered *“suitable for joyful, heavenly music”* – many Disney-inspired or fantasy scores use Lydian to sound “magical.” Thus, mixing a major scale with an unexpected raised IV chord, or alternating distant chords, paints a magical, imaginative mood.

## Anticipation & Suspense

* **Curious (Interested):** A playful sense of curiosity can be created with a progression that creates mild tension and then resolves, like asking a question then answering. For example, **G – Gsus4 – G – C**. Here the Gsus4 chord (which adds a *“delightful tension”* by temporarily suspending the 3rd) makes the listener anticipate the resolution back to G. When it resolves and then moves to C (the subdominant, leaving the phrase open-ended), it feels like the curiosity is piqued rather than fully satisfied. The use of a **suspended chord** is key: it signals that something is coming (just as a question inflection does in speech) without sounding dark or dissonant. The overall major tonality keeps it light-hearted, suitable for intrigued or expectant curiosity.
* **Anticipation (Excited):** For an excited, eager anticipation (think looking forward to something positive), a progression that continuously builds can be used. **C – D – G/B – C** is an example in C major. It starts on the tonic C, moves to an unexpected D major (II, borrowed from the Lydian as a secondary dominant of V), which raises energy, then to G/B (V in first inversion, leading tone in bass) which further pushes to resolve, and finally lands back on C. The inclusion of the major II (D) creates a *leading anticipation* (often used in gospel-style cadences for an *“expectant, giddy excitement”*). Each chord here intensifies the pull back to the tonic, so when the loop repeats it feels like it’s constantly about to burst – much like positive anticipation building up.
* **Suspense (Worried Anticipation):** To depict suspense – a mix of anticipation and dread – it’s effective to use a loop that *fails to resolve*, keeping the listener on edge. For instance, **A minor – B♭ - A minor - B♭...** (alternating between Am and a foreign B♭ major chord) never truly resolves to a tonal “home.” The B♭ (a ♭II in A minor) is a jarring chord (a “Neapolitan” chord) that, when returned to Am, still feels unsettled. This kind of approach (bouncing between two uneasy chords) is unsettling because our ear expects a resolution that never comes. As one guide notes, *“don’t resolve chord progressions – \[disrupting expectation] can create a sense of unease for the listener”*. Thus, a suspense progression often forms an *uneasy loop*. Another example: **Em – F♯m – Em – F♯m...** (oscillating between Em and F♯m, two minor chords a whole tone apart) creates a similar effect of unresolved tension, suitable for a suspenseful cliffhanger feeling.
* **Dread (Apprehension):** (Combining elements of fear and anticipation) A rising line that never quite “lands” can illustrate dread. For example, a chromatic ascending progression like **Dm – Fm – A♭m – Bm** (each chord a minor third above the last) continuously lifts in a menacing way. Because it modulates by minor thirds, it never establishes a clear key center, keeping us disoriented. Each upward shift increases intensity (like a tightening coil), but since it’s all minor chords, the mood is dark. This technique was used in horror scores to build an impending sense of doom. By the time the sequence reaches Bm, it could loop or break – but until it resolves (which it often intentionally doesn’t), the listener feels mounting dread. In summary, steadily increasing harmonic tension without resolution mirrors the feeling of impending doom or extreme anxiety.

## Calm & Serenity

* **Calm (Serene/Accepting):** To evoke calmness, we use stable, consonant harmonies often enriched with gentle extensions. **Cmaj7 – Fmaj7 – Cmaj7** (Imaj7 – IVmaj7 – Imaj7 in C) is a soothing progression. The major seventh chords have a warm, ambient quality — *“romance, softness, serenity, tranquility”* are all traits of the **major 7th chord**. In this progression, nothing is minor or dissonant; the IV–I motion is a **plagal cadence** (sometimes called the “Amen” cadence due to its use in hymns), which has a restful, resolved sound. The acceptance aspect (as in feeling at peace or content with the world) is reinforced by the lack of tension – there are no leading tones demanding resolution, and the chords smoothly share notes (Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 both contain the note E, for instance, creating a seamless, lush connection). Overall, the music just **“flows”**. A listener can relax into it, as the progression gently moves and then settles back, embodying musical contentment and trust.

## Trust & Security

* **Trust (Confident):** A stable, resolving progression that feels dependable and secure. **C – F – Am – G – C** (I–IV–vi–V–I) provides a complete cycle that always returns home, embodying reliability. The inclusion of the vi chord (Am) adds depth while the strong V–I resolution reinforces trust and confidence. This progression appears in countless hymns and folk songs associated with themes of faith and dependability.
* **Secure (Safe):** For a feeling of safety and protection, use warm, consonant harmonies with gentle voice leading. **Fmaj7 – C/E – Dm7 – G – C** creates a cocoon-like harmonic environment. The maj7 chords provide warmth without tension, and the bass line (F-E-D-G-C) moves smoothly downward then resolves upward, like settling into safety.
* **Loyal (Devotion):** A progression that returns faithfully to its tonic suggests loyalty and devotion. **G – C – G – D – G** (I–IV–I–V–I in G major) keeps coming back to G major, reinforcing the sense of faithful return. The repetition of the tonic chord mirrors the constancy of loyalty.

## Shame & Guilt

* **Shame (Embarrassed):** A progression that seems to shrink or withdraw musically captures shame. **C – Bb – F – C** uses the bVII (Bb) which creates a modal mixture that darkens the major key slightly, suggesting the withdrawal and dimming associated with shame. The progression resolves back to C but the bVII leaves a shadow.
* **Guilt (Remorseful):** For guilt and remorse, use a progression with unresolved dissonance that seeks forgiveness. **Am – F – G7sus4 – G7 – C** includes a suspended dominant that delays resolution, musically representing the seeking of forgiveness. The sus4 chord creates tension that mirrors the discomfort of guilt before resolving.
* **Regret (Wishful):** A progression that seems to look backward with longing. **C – G/B – Am – F – G – C** includes the first inversion G chord (G/B) which creates a descending bass line (C-B-A-F-G-C), musically depicting the backward glance of regret while still finding resolution.

## Envy & Jealousy

* **Envy (Resentful):** A progression with chromatic movement and unresolved tensions. **Em – F – G – Ab – Am** uses the unexpected Ab chord (bII relative to Am) which creates a bitter, unresolved quality. The chromatic ascent (F-G-Ab) builds tension that only partially resolves to Am, leaving resentment hanging.
* **Jealous (Possessive):** Sharp, angular chord changes that feel grasping or clutching. **Dm – A7 – Dm – Bb – A7** oscillates between minor and dominant seventh chords, creating an obsessive, circling quality. The A7 chord repeatedly pulls toward Dm but the Bb interrupts, suggesting the possessive nature of jealousy.

## Pride & Confidence

* **Pride (Triumphant):** Bold, ascending progressions in major keys. **C – F – G – C – C7 – F – G – C** uses the added C7 (I7) as a secondary dominant that brightens the progression further, creating a triumphant, chest-swelling feeling. The repetition reinforces confidence and pride.
* **Confident (Assured):** Strong, decisive chord movements with clear resolution. **F – Bb – C – F** (I–IV–V–I in F major) moves with conviction through the classic cadential progression. The decisiveness of each chord change mirrors musical confidence.
* **Arrogant (Haughty):** Progressions that avoid expected resolutions, suggesting superiority. **C – E – Am – F – G – C** uses the unexpected E major chord (III in C major) which creates a sharp, almost aggressive brightness that can sound haughty or superior.

## Vulnerability & Tenderness

* **Vulnerable (Exposed):** Sparse, open harmonies that feel unprotected. **Am – Fmaj7 – C – G** uses major seventh chords and wide spacing to create an exposed, delicate feeling. The major seventh intervals create beautiful but fragile harmonies.
* **Tender (Gentle):** Soft, caressing harmonies with smooth voice leading. **Cmaj9 – Am7 – Fmaj7 – G7sus4 – C** uses ninth chords and suspended tones to create a gentle, embracing harmonic environment. The sus4 resolution provides gentle tension and release.
* **Fragile (Delicate):** High, thin voicings that seem ready to break. **Em7 – A7sus4 – Dmaj7 – G7sus4 – Cmaj7** uses suspended chords and major sevenths in higher registers to create a crystalline, fragile beauty.

## Excitement & Energy

* **Excited (Enthusiastic):** Rapid harmonic rhythm and unexpected chord changes. **C – A7 – Dm – G7 – Em – A7 – Dm – G7 – C** moves quickly through secondary dominants and creates an energetic, bouncing feeling.
* **Energetic (Vigorous):** Strong, driving progressions with modal interchange. **Am – F – C – G – Am – F – C – G** creates a relentless, driving energy through its steady eighth-note feel and strong harmonic motion.
* **Exhilarated (Thrilled):** Bright, soaring progressions that seem to lift off. **C – G/B – Am – F – C/E – Dm – G – C** includes first inversions that create ascending bass lines, musically depicting the uplifting feeling of exhilaration.

## Contemplation & Reflection

* **Contemplative (Thoughtful):** Slow-moving, harmonically rich progressions that encourage introspection. **Cmaj7 – Em7 – Am7 – Fmaj7 – Dm7 – G7sus4 – Cmaj7** uses entirely seventh chords with smooth voice leading, creating a meditative, flowing harmonic landscape.
* **Reflective (Pensive):** Progressions that seem to circle back on themselves. **Am – F – C – G – Em – Am** creates a gentle cycle that encourages reflection and introspection through its circular motion.
* **Meditative (Peaceful):** Modal progressions that avoid strong resolutions. **Dm – Bb – F – C – Dm** uses the natural minor mode to create a floating, meditative quality without the pull of leading tones.

## Longing & Yearning

* **Longing (Yearning):** Progressions with unresolved leading tones and suspended chords. **Am – F – G – Em – F – G7sus4 – Am** includes the suspended dominant that delays resolution, musically representing the ache of longing.
* **Wistful (Sentimental):** Progressions that mix major and minor with gentle dissonance. **C – Am – Dm – G7 – Em – Am – F – G – C** weaves through relative major and minor tonalities, creating the bittersweet quality of wistfulness.
* **Pining (Aching):** Progressions with chromatic voice leading that seems to reach upward. **Fm – G – Ab – Bb – Cm** creates an ascending chromatic line that mirrors the reaching quality of pining or aching for something distant.

# Emotion-to-Chord Progression Mapping

Below is a comprehensive mapping of various **sub-emotions** to a representative **chord progression** that captures the mood. Each progression is chosen based on music theory insights and credible sources. *(Note: Major chords are denoted by capital letters, minor chords by the letter plus “m”, and other chord types are specified as needed.)* Citations are provided to validate the emotional qualities of the chords or progressions.

## Joy & Positive Emotions

* **Cheerful:** A bright, simple major-key progression such as **C – F – G – C** (I–IV–V–I in C major) evokes happiness and energy. This uses only major chords, which are strongly associated with *“happiness, cheerfulness, \[and] brightness”*. In general, *“predictable progressions with major chords reflect contentment and happiness”*, so the classic I–IV–V loop feels upbeat and satisfying.
* **Contentment:** A very stable progression like **C – G – C** (I–V–I) conveys calm satisfaction. Ending on the tonic (I) after the dominant (V) gives a sense of resolution and completeness, matching a content, resolved emotional state. Because major chords and straightforward progressions *“reflect contentment and happiness”*, a simple tonic-dominant return feels peacefully resolved.
* **Optimistic (Hopeful):** A progression featuring an added 9th or sustaining tones suggests openness and hope. For example, **C – G – Am – Fadd9** builds from I to vi and ends on an Fadd9 chord, adding a color tone to a major chord. Such **ninth chords** convey *“openness \[and] optimism”*. The rising motion to the vi chord (Am) and the unresolved added 9th create a feeling of forward-looking expectancy characteristic of hope.

## Love & Romance

* **Romantic (Loving):** Lush, soft chords with gentle resolutions fit a loving mood. A classic romantic progression is **C – Am – F – G7** (I–vi–IV–V⁷) often used in love songs (the "50s progression"). This blends major and minor chords, moving from the warm C major to its relative minor (Am) for a bittersweet touch, then resolving through F to a G⁷ dominant. Major seventh chords can also add a dreamy quality – for example **Cmaj7 – Gmaj7 – Am7 – Fmaj7** yields rich harmony. Major 7ths are literally described as evoking *“romance, softness, ... serenity”*. Overall, the I–vi–IV–V progression gives a nostalgic, heartfelt feeling, suitable for love.

## Sadness & Grief

* **Melancholy (Gently Sad):** A minor-key progression with a touch of unresolved tension captures gentle sadness. **A minor – F – G – E** (vi–IV–V–V/V in C major; i–♭VI–♭VII–V in A minor) is an example. The move from Am to F and G gives a wistful, longing sound, and ending on the E major (V in Am) instead of resolving back to Am leaves a hint of yearning. Minor chords naturally convey *“sadness, melancholy, darkness”*, and the inclusion of the major V (E major in A minor) adds a glimmer of tension that feels like longing or regret.
* **Sad / Sorrowful:** A descending progression in a minor key often signifies deep sadness. For instance, **A minor – G – F – E (Am)** is a common sorrowful sequence (i–VII–VI–V in A minor). The stepwise descent (A→G→F→E in the bass) mirrors a sighing, downward motion. Such progressions were famously used in classical pieces (e.g. Pachelbel’s Canon’s relative minor variation) and pop ballads, and they *“signal sadness right away”*. The minor tonic and submediant (F) especially reinforce the *“sullen, depressing”* tone of sadness.
* **Grief (Despair):** An extended minor progression with unexpected chords can represent intense despair. For example, **A minor – G – F – Am – Eⁿ – F – Gsus4 – G** (as suggested for “mourning”) travels through a longer phrase, heightening the emotional journey. The progression starts in somber Am, dips to the subdominant (F) and back, then introduces an E major (Eⁿ) for a harsh leading-tone pull, and finally rises through F to a suspended G resolving to G major. The use of the *suspended 4th (Gsus4 resolving to G)* provides *“delightful tension”* even in a grieving context – the temporary refusal to resolve mirrors the pain of loss before a final acceptance on G. Overall, heavy use of minor and diminished tones here paints a picture of anguish.
* **Nostalgic (Bittersweet):** A progression that blends major and minor can evoke nostalgia – sad but with warmth. A quintessential example is the **C – A minor – F – G** doo-wop progression (I–vi–IV–V in C). This `50s progression` is known to *“evoke some classy sadness and nostalgia”*. The shift from C major to its relative minor (Am) gives a bittersweet feeling (happy memories tinged with sadness), and the strong resolution back to C via F–G feels like fond remembrance. Nostalgia in music often comes from this interplay of major and minor, capturing mixed emotions.

## Anger & Aggression

* **Frustrated (Annoyed):** A progression that builds tension without immediate release suits frustration. Using suspended chords that resolve into a minor chord can achieve this. For example, **Dsus2 – Dsus4 – Dm** repeatedly elevates the tension on D (adding 2nd then 4th) before dropping into D minor. This *“Suspended Storm”* style progression *“builds anticipation and unresolved tension before finally resolving to a minor chord”*, mirroring a rising irritation that finally snaps. The suspended chords create an anxious, unsettled feel (appropriate for annoyance), and when the chord resolves to minor, it’s like the frustration has burst through briefly.
* **Angry:** A minor progression with a downward or unresolved movement captures anger’s dark, brooding quality. **A minor – Dm – Gm** (i–iv–v in A minor, ending on an unresolved v chord) is one such *“Classic Minor Downfall”* progression *“moving from Am to Dm to Gm”* that *“perfectly reflects the essence of anger”*. Each chord adds layers of tension: all three are minor (sadness and tension inherent), and the sequence descends in tonal center (A down to G by way of Dm) which can feel like sinking deeper into anger. Ending on Gm (the v chord unresolved to the i) leaves a sense of unrest – exactly how anger often feels unresolved.
* **Rage (Enraged):** For full-blown rage, dissonance and unstable chords are key. A progression like **C minor – G⁰ – Dm** (i – v° – iv in C minor, where G° is the diminished chord on the dominant) exemplifies this intensity. In this *“Diminished Drive”* progression, the diminished chord *“introduces a sharp, biting tension… amplifying the anger conveyed”*. Diminished chords are formed of stacked minor thirds and are inherently unstable; in fact, the diminished chord is often cited as *“the darkest chord in music”*. By wedging a fully diminished chord between minor chords, the music conveys volatility and fury. The listener feels no safe resolution, only a driving, relentless tension – much like the rush of rage itself.

## Fear & Tension

* **Anxious (Nervous):** A jarring progression that oscillates or never settles can represent anxiety. For instance, **G minor – A♭/G – Gm – A♮/G** (alternating Gm with an A major chord over a G bass) creates an uneasy rocking motion. This is similar to a *“thriller/suspense”* pattern used in soundtracks. The bass stays on G, but the chords above shift between G minor and an A major (which is a half-step higher root). That major chord over the static bass introduces a dissonant major second interval (G against A in the harmony), generating a *suspenseful, worried* feel. The music feels stuck in a loop of tension – much like the looping worry of anxiety.
* **Afraid (Fearful):** A progression featuring a **diminished chord** captures fear and dread. For example, **A minor – B° – E (or A minor)** is effective (here B° is the diminished chord built on the 2nd scale degree of A minor, leading to either E major or back to Am). Diminished chords are famously associated with *“fear, shock, spookiness, \[and] suspense”*. In this progression, Am establishes a dark mood, the B° chord (built on the unstable tritone from the scale) spikes the tension with its dissonant, unstable tone, and then resolving to E major (the dominant of Am) leaves a hanging feeling that another cycle will repeat (unresolved to Am directly). The net effect is an unresolved ominous atmosphere – we sense fear of something lurking, as the music never fully “comes home” to safety.
* **Terrified (Horrified):** Extreme fear can be conveyed by relentlessly dark, chromatic chord movement. For instance, **E♭m – D° – F° – E♭m** (a progression from a drill music example) is *“the darkest of them all, thanks to some grim-sounding diminished chords”*. Here the tonal center shifts by **chromatic** steps: E♭ minor to D diminished to F diminished and back to E♭m. The diminished chords are packed with dissonance (diminished = stacked minor 3rds) and moving them in half-step relations maximizes the tension. This feels chaotic and nightmarish – as one might feel in terror. Another approach is a “danger motif” like **Fm – E♭m/F – Fm – F♯m/F**, which keeps an F pedal tone while sliding the chord underneath from F minor to E♭ minor and then to F♯ minor. The clashing semitone (F vs F♯) and sudden shifts produce a spine-chilling discord. In sum, heavy use of dissonant/diminished chords and chromatic motion portrays raw terror.

## Disgust & Aversion

* **Disgust (Repulsed):** Music conveying disgust often uses clashing, unsettling harmonies that push the listener away. A good example is a dominant seventh with a flattened ninth, which has a very tense sound. For instance, **B⁷♭9 resolving to Em** can sound unsettling and “wrong.” A C7♭9 chord in isolation is described as evoking *“creepiness, ominousness”* – those same qualities align with a feeling of disgust or distrust. In a progression, the C7♭9 (for example) could lead to an Fm chord, never giving the expected resolution (C7 normally resolves to F major, but resolving to F minor or another unexpected chord keeps it uneasy). The dissonant interval between the root and the flatted 9th in the chord creates a nausea-inducing clash. By using such a chord, the music instills an uneasy, queasy tension in the listener – much like the feeling of disgust.
* **Loathing (Hatred):** For an extreme aversion or loathing, we combine dissonance with heavy, dark resolution. A progression like **B minor – Caug – Dm** is illustrative. This moves from Bm (already dark) to C augmented (C+), then to D minor. The *augmented chord* (C+) contains a raised fifth, which produces a dissonant, unstable sound, heightening tension. In the context above, the augmented C acts like a “wrong” major chord between two minor chords – the result is jarring. The move into Dm after the C+ gives some resolution but not a happy one – it’s a bitter resolution into another minor mood. This kind of progression (resembling the *“Dissonant Dance”* described by one source) *“provides a palpable sense of unease”* and leaves *“a lingering sense of conflict”*. It effectively paints musical loathing: the sound feels conflicted, dark, and unsettled, as if the music itself “hates” where it’s going. (Notably, such chord moves are often used in horror or villain themes, which overlap with feelings of extreme aversion.)

## Surprise & Wonder

* **Shock (Startled):** An abrupt change from minor to major (or vice versa) can musically “startle” the listener, mirroring the feeling of shock. For example, **C minor → C major** (moll-dur shift on the tonic) within a progression is striking. This kind of *“Minor–Major shift”* *“plays with listeners’ expectations by abruptly changing from a minor chord to a major chord,”* which can *“evoke surprise and discomfort”*. One moment the harmony is dark, the next it’s suddenly bright – a musical jump-scare. Another way to induce shock is an unexpected **tritone leap or chord** (since the tritone is historically the “Devil’s interval” known for its unnerving effect). The key is the element of *the unexpected*; as one music psychology expert notes, *“when we hear something dissonant \[or out of place], it gives you a little emotional frisson because it’s strange and unexpected”* – just the effect we get from a sudden chord that doesn’t belong.
* **Amazed (In Awe):** For a sense of awe or astonished wonder, a progression that feels expansive, ethereal, or “magical” is ideal. One such progression is **E minor – C minor** alternating (Em → Cm → Em → Cm …). This was suggested as a “magical” sound. Here the music shifts between two minor chords a major third apart, a type of chromatic mediant relationship that *“disrupts the expected tonality, creating a sense of intrigue”*【24†L226-L234}. The unusual pairing of Em and Cm (no shared key) gives a mystical, otherworldly vibe – as if the music is floating between worlds. This evokes awe and wonder. Another example is **F – B♭ – G♭ – D♭** (all major chords in a non-diatonic sequence), akin to the *“Awe & Wonder”* progression【2†L53-L58】. The bold jumps through distant major chords feel triumphant yet beyond comprehension – much like being awestruck by something larger than life.
* **Mysterious (Enigmatic):** To convey mystery, composers often use modal or chromatic chords that don’t immediately reveal if they are major or minor. A progression like **F minor – A major – Fm – C♯m** is a prime example of *“Mysterious & Tense”* harmony. It starts in F minor (somber), jumps to A major (a startling shift up a major third to a bright chord), then back to Fm and down to C♯ minor (another unexpected shift). These chromatic mediants and mode-mixing chords *“effectively disrupt the diatonic scale, creating a sense of unease and intrigue”*. The listener isn’t sure what key we’re in or where it will go next, which perfectly underscores a feeling of mystery or secrecy. The tension of mystery is thus maintained by avoiding straightforward resolutions and employing unusual chord relationships.
* **Magical (Enchanted):** For a whimsical, enchanted feeling (related to awe but more whimsical), combining major and minor in an unconventional way works well. The earlier **Em ↔ Cm** progression under “Amazed” applies here too – it was explicitly labeled “Magical” for its spellbinding quality. Another trick for a magical vibe is using **Lydian mode** chords (Lydian has a sharpened 4th scale degree that gives a dreamy quality). For instance, in C Lydian, a **C – D (maj II) – G – C** progression uses a D major (II in Lydian) which is outside C major. This raised 4th (F♯ in the context of C) adds a sense of wonder and brightness. Historically, modes like **Lydian** were considered *“suitable for joyful, heavenly music”* – many Disney-inspired or fantasy scores use Lydian to sound “magical.” Thus, mixing a major scale with an unexpected raised IV chord, or alternating distant chords, paints a magical, imaginative mood.

## Anticipation & Suspense

* **Curious (Interested):** A playful sense of curiosity can be created with a progression that creates mild tension and then resolves, like asking a question then answering. For example, **G – Gsus4 – G – C**. Here the Gsus4 chord (which adds a *“delightful tension”* by temporarily suspending the 3rd) makes the listener anticipate the resolution back to G. When it resolves and then moves to C (the subdominant, leaving the phrase open-ended), it feels like the curiosity is piqued rather than fully satisfied. The use of a **suspended chord** is key: it signals that something is coming (just as a question inflection does in speech) without sounding dark or dissonant. The overall major tonality keeps it light-hearted, suitable for intrigued or expectant curiosity.
* **Anticipation (Excited):** For an excited, eager anticipation (think looking forward to something positive), a progression that continuously builds can be used. **C – D – G/B – C** is an example in C major. It starts on the tonic C, moves to an unexpected D major (II, borrowed from the Lydian as a secondary dominant of V), which raises energy, then to G/B (V in first inversion, leading tone in bass) which further pushes to resolve, and finally lands back on C. The inclusion of the major II (D) creates a *leading anticipation* (often used in gospel-style cadences for an *“expectant, giddy excitement”*). Each chord here intensifies the pull back to the tonic, so when the loop repeats it feels like it’s constantly about to burst – much like positive anticipation building up.
* **Suspense (Worried Anticipation):** To depict suspense – a mix of anticipation and dread – it’s effective to use a loop that *fails to resolve*, keeping the listener on edge. For instance, **A minor – B♭ - A minor - B♭...** (alternating between Am and a foreign B♭ major chord) never truly resolves to a tonal “home.” The B♭ (a ♭II in A minor) is a jarring chord (a “Neapolitan” chord) that, when returned to Am, still feels unsettled. This kind of approach (bouncing between two uneasy chords) is unsettling because our ear expects a resolution that never comes. As one guide notes, *“don’t resolve chord progressions – \[disrupting expectation] can create a sense of unease for the listener”*. Thus, a suspense progression often forms an *uneasy loop*. Another example: **Em – F♯m – Em – F♯m...** (oscillating between Em and F♯m, two minor chords a whole tone apart) creates a similar effect of unresolved tension, suitable for a suspenseful cliffhanger feeling.
* **Dread (Apprehension):** (Combining elements of fear and anticipation) A rising line that never quite “lands” can illustrate dread. For example, a chromatic ascending progression like **Dm – Fm – A♭m – Bm** (each chord a minor third above the last) continuously lifts in a menacing way. Because it modulates by minor thirds, it never establishes a clear key center, keeping us disoriented. Each upward shift increases intensity (like a tightening coil), but since it’s all minor chords, the mood is dark. This technique was used in horror scores to build an impending sense of doom. By the time the sequence reaches Bm, it could loop or break – but until it resolves (which it often intentionally doesn’t), the listener feels mounting dread. In summary, steadily increasing harmonic tension without resolution mirrors the feeling of impending doom or extreme anxiety.

## Calm & Serenity

* **Calm (Serene/Accepting):** To evoke calmness, we use stable, consonant harmonies often enriched with gentle extensions. **Cmaj7 – Fmaj7 – Cmaj7** (Imaj7 – IVmaj7 – Imaj7 in C) is a soothing progression. The major seventh chords have a warm, ambient quality — *“romance, softness, serenity, tranquility”* are all traits of the **major 7th chord**. In this progression, nothing is minor or dissonant; the IV–I motion is a **plagal cadence** (sometimes called the “Amen” cadence due to its use in hymns), which has a restful, resolved sound. The acceptance aspect (as in feeling at peace or content with the world) is reinforced by the lack of tension – there are no leading tones demanding resolution, and the chords smoothly share notes (Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 both contain the note E, for instance, creating a seamless, lush connection). Overall, the music just **“flows”**. A listener can relax into it, as the progression gently moves and then settles back, embodying musical contentment and trust.

## Trust & Security

* **Trust (Confident):** A stable, resolving progression that feels dependable and secure. **C – F – Am – G – C** (I–IV–vi–V–I) provides a complete cycle that always returns home, embodying reliability. The inclusion of the vi chord (Am) adds depth while the strong V–I resolution reinforces trust and confidence. This progression appears in countless hymns and folk songs associated with themes of faith and dependability.
* **Secure (Safe):** For a feeling of safety and protection, use warm, consonant harmonies with gentle voice leading. **Fmaj7 – C/E – Dm7 – G – C** creates a cocoon-like harmonic environment. The maj7 chords provide warmth without tension, and the bass line (F-E-D-G-C) moves smoothly downward then resolves upward, like settling into safety.
* **Loyal (Devotion):** A progression that returns faithfully to its tonic suggests loyalty and devotion. **G – C – G – D – G** (I–IV–I–V–I in G major) keeps coming back to G major, reinforcing the sense of faithful return. The repetition of the tonic chord mirrors the constancy of loyalty.

## Shame & Guilt

* **Shame (Embarrassed):** A progression that seems to shrink or withdraw musically captures shame. **C – Bb – F – C** uses the bVII (Bb) which creates a modal mixture that darkens the major key slightly, suggesting the withdrawal and dimming associated with shame. The progression resolves back to C but the bVII leaves a shadow.
* **Guilt (Remorseful):** For guilt and remorse, use a progression with unresolved dissonance that seeks forgiveness. **Am – F – G7sus4 – G7 – C** includes a suspended dominant that delays resolution, musically representing the seeking of forgiveness. The sus4 chord creates tension that mirrors the discomfort of guilt before resolving.
* **Regret (Wishful):** A progression that seems to look backward with longing. **C – G/B – Am – F – G – C** includes the first inversion G chord (G/B) which creates a descending bass line (C-B-A-F-G-C), musically depicting the backward glance of regret while still finding resolution.

## Envy & Jealousy

* **Envy (Resentful):** A progression with chromatic movement and unresolved tensions. **Em – F – G – Ab – Am** uses the unexpected Ab chord (bII relative to Am) which creates a bitter, unresolved quality. The chromatic ascent (F-G-Ab) builds tension that only partially resolves to Am, leaving resentment hanging.
* **Jealous (Possessive):** Sharp, angular chord changes that feel grasping or clutching. **Dm – A7 – Dm – Bb – A7** oscillates between minor and dominant seventh chords, creating an obsessive, circling quality. The A7 chord repeatedly pulls toward Dm but the Bb interrupts, suggesting the possessive nature of jealousy.

## Pride & Confidence

* **Pride (Triumphant):** Bold, ascending progressions in major keys. **C – F – G – C – C7 – F – G – C** uses the added C7 (I7) as a secondary dominant that brightens the progression further, creating a triumphant, chest-swelling feeling. The repetition reinforces confidence and pride.
* **Confident (Assured):** Strong, decisive chord movements with clear resolution. **F – Bb – C – F** (I–IV–V–I in F major) moves with conviction through the classic cadential progression. The decisiveness of each chord change mirrors musical confidence.
* **Arrogant (Haughty):** Progressions that avoid expected resolutions, suggesting superiority. **C – E – Am – F – G – C** uses the unexpected E major chord (III in C major) which creates a sharp, almost aggressive brightness that can sound haughty or superior.

## Vulnerability & Tenderness

* **Vulnerable (Exposed):** Sparse, open harmonies that feel unprotected. **Am – Fmaj7 – C – G** uses major seventh chords and wide spacing to create an exposed, delicate feeling. The major seventh intervals create beautiful but fragile harmonies.
* **Tender (Gentle):** Soft, caressing harmonies with smooth voice leading. **Cmaj9 – Am7 – Fmaj7 – G7sus4 – C** uses ninth chords and suspended tones to create a gentle, embracing harmonic environment. The sus4 resolution provides gentle tension and release.
* **Fragile (Delicate):** High, thin voicings that seem ready to break. **Em7 – A7sus4 – Dmaj7 – G7sus4 – Cmaj7** uses suspended chords and major sevenths in higher registers to create a crystalline, fragile beauty.

## Excitement & Energy

* **Excited (Enthusiastic):** Rapid harmonic rhythm and unexpected chord changes. **C – A7 – Dm – G7 – Em – A7 – Dm – G7 – C** moves quickly through secondary dominants and creates an energetic, bouncing feeling.
* **Energetic (Vigorous):** Strong, driving progressions with modal interchange. **Am – F – C – G – Am – F – C – G** creates a relentless, driving energy through its steady eighth-note feel and strong harmonic motion.
* **Exhilarated (Thrilled):** Bright, soaring progressions that seem to lift off. **C – G/B – Am – F – C/E – Dm – G – C** includes first inversions that create ascending bass lines, musically depicting the uplifting feeling of exhilaration.

## Contemplation & Reflection

* **Contemplative (Thoughtful):** Slow-moving, harmonically rich progressions that encourage introspection. **Cmaj7 – Em7 – Am7 – Fmaj7 – Dm7 – G7sus4 – Cmaj7** uses entirely seventh chords with smooth voice leading, creating a meditative, flowing harmonic landscape.
* **Reflective (Pensive):** Progressions that seem to circle back on themselves. **Am – F – C – G – Em – Am** creates a gentle cycle that encourages reflection and introspection through its circular motion.
* **Meditative (Peaceful):** Modal progressions that avoid strong resolutions. **Dm – Bb – F – C – Dm** uses the natural minor mode to create a floating, meditative quality without the pull of leading tones.

## Longing & Yearning

* **Longing (Yearning):** Progressions with unresolved leading tones and suspended chords. **Am – F – G – Em – F – G7sus4 – Am** includes the suspended dominant that delays resolution, musically representing the ache of longing.
* **Wistful (Sentimental):** Progressions that mix major and minor with gentle dissonance. **C – Am – Dm – G7 – Em – Am – F – G – C** weaves through relative major and minor tonalities, creating the bittersweet quality of wistfulness.
* **Pining (Aching):** Progressions with chromatic voice leading that seems to reach upward. **Fm – G – Ab – Bb – Cm** creates an ascending chromatic line that mirrors the reaching quality of pining or aching for something distant.
