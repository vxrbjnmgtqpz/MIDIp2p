@copilotlog.md start at the very end of this document and read back until you've gathered the necessary context to pick up where copilot left off

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to read the copilotlog.md file from the end, going backwards to gather context and understand where copilot left off. This will help me understand the current state of the project and pick up the conversation from where it was left.

I should read the file to see what the last entries were and understand the context.</details></think>

I'll read the copilotlog.md file to understand the context and where the previous conversation left off.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The file is quite long (5585 lines) and I'm only seeing the first 200 lines. I need to read from the end backwards to gather the most recent context as requested by the user. Let me read the last portion of the file to see where copilot left off.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Based on reading the end of the copilotlog.md file, I can see the context of where Copilot left off. It appears that:

1. A major integration milestone was recently completed - the Phase 2 integration of MIDILink with the JSONMIDI Framework
2. The project was successfully backed up to git with a milestone tag v0.5.0-phase2-integration-complete
3. The user then provided an older ChatGPT assessment that listed various requirements that "still need to be done"
4. Copilot was trying to analyze what's actually been implemented vs what the older assessment claimed was missing
5. The conversation ended with multiple "@agent Try Again" attempts where Copilot seems to have had trouble responding

The user is asking me to review that older ChatGPT assessment and determine if any of those requirements were overlooked and actually need to be implemented, or if they're already covered in the existing framework.

Let me examine the current state of the framework to understand what's actually implemented and compare it to the requirements listed in that assessment.</details></think>

Based on reading the copilotlog.md file from the end, I can see that Copilot had just completed a major Phase 2 integration milestone and then encountered an older ChatGPT assessment that listed requirements. Let me examine what's actually implemented in the current framework versus what that older assessment claimed was missing.
